        D: "The year 1914 marks the beginning of the last days, a pivotal time in Bible prophecy when Jehovah established His Kingdom in heaven. Daniel 4:17 foretells that Jehovah gives rulership to His chosen one, fulfilled when Jesus was enthroned as King in 1914, as calculated from the ‘seven times’ prophecy (Daniel 4:25). Luke 21:24 indicates that the ‘appointed times of the nations’ ended in 1914, ushering in Christ’s heavenly rule. Revelation 12:12 describes Satan’s expulsion from heaven, intensifying woes on earth, as seen in the global conflicts and turmoil since 1914 (Matthew 24:7). 2 Timothy 3:1-5 accurately describes the moral decay of these last days. Jehovah’s Witnesses are certain that 1914 began Jesus’ presence as King, initiating the final period before Armageddon. This truth drives their urgent preaching work, as they proclaim the established Kingdom that will soon bring Jehovah’s will to earth."

Psalm 139:16 affirms that Jehovah sees the unborn as individuals, with their days planned in His book. Exodus 21:22, 23 equates the loss of an unborn child’s life to murder, demanding a life for a life. Job 31:15 and Isaiah 44:24 emphasize Jehovah’s role as the Creator who forms each person in the womb. Luke 1:41 shows the unborn are responsive, as John leaped in Elizabeth’s womb. Abortion ends a human life that Jehovah has purposed, contradicting His view of its sanctity. Jehovah’s Witnesses firmly uphold that all life, born or unborn, is precious to God, and they reject abortion as incompatible with His standards. Trusting the Bible’s clear guidance, they advocate for protecting the unborn, confident that Jehovah values every human life from conception."

Psalm 115:17 reinforces that the dead cannot praise Jehovah, rendering ancestor worship futile. 1 Timothy 2:5 declares Jesus as the sole mediator, making reliance on ancestors unnecessary and contrary to true worship. Jehovah’s Witnesses are certain that ancestor worship stems from false religious teachings and demonic influence, leading people away from Jehovah.

Jehovah’s Witnesses are certain that angels are actively involved in supporting the preaching work and safeguarding the righteous today, just as in Bible times. Their invisible presence strengthens faith, affirming Jehovah’s care for His servants. Angels serve only Jehovah’s will, and any worship or undue focus on them is unscriptural.

        D: "Zeal is fervent devotion to Jehovah, and the Bible encourages it. Romans 12:11 urges being aglow with spirit. Titus 2:14 praises zeal for good works. John 2:17 reflects Jesus’ zeal. Revelation 3:19 calls for zealous repentance. Galatians 4:18 supports zeal for good. Jehovah’s Witnesses are certain that zeal—shown in preaching, worship, and obedience—reflects love for Jehovah. They serve energetically, even amidst challenges. This truth ensures their ministry is vibrant, drawing others to God. Jehovah’s Witnesses cultivate zeal, confident it honors Jehovah and prepares them for everlasting life in His Kingdom, where zeal will fuel eternal worship."
