                        <p>To accept Bible truth, your personality matters. Some resist because they’ve been indoctrinated with lies for years. Jehovah seeks those with the right traits to break free and learn. What are they?</p>
                        <p><strong>Are you hungry for truth?</strong> A deep desire to know Jehovah drives you to seek His Word over human traditions.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Matthew 5:6 - “Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Are you honest with yourself?</strong> Facing the truth means admitting you might have been misled—hard, but vital for growth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Proverbs 12:17 - “The one speaking truth declares what is right, but a false witness speaks deceit.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Are you humble enough to change?</strong> Pride blocks learning; humility opens your heart to Jehovah’s correction.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">James 4:6 - “God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Are you open-minded to new ideas?</strong> Overcoming indoctrination requires examining the Bible without prejudice.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Acts 17:11 - “They accepted the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Do you have courage to stand apart?</strong> Truth often means rejecting popular lies—courage keeps you firm.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Joshua 1:9 - “Be courageous and strong… for Jehovah your God is with you.”</p>
                        <p>These traits—hunger, honesty, humility, open-mindedness, and courage—equip you to see past a lifetime of lies and embrace Jehovah’s truth!</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>1914 marks the pivotal year when Jehovah enthroned Jesus as King in heaven, beginning his invisible presence and the last days, as foretold in Bible prophecy. Calculated from Daniel’s “seven times” and linked to Revelation, it saw global upheaval—war, pestilence, and distress—fulfilling Jesus’ sign. Jehovah’s Witnesses proclaim this turning point, urging readiness for the Kingdom’s full arrival.</p>
                        <p>It’s prophesied.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Daniel 4:25 - “Seven times will pass over you… Most High is Ruler.”</p>
                        <p>Jesus rules.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Revelation 11:15 - “The kingdom of the world has become… our Lord’s and… his Christ.”</p>
                        <p>Signs confirm it.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Matthew 24:7 - “Nation will rise against nation… famines… earthquakes.”</p>
                        <p>It warns us.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">2 Timothy 3:1 - “In the last days critical times hard to deal with.”</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Abortion, the deliberate termination of a pregnancy, violates Jehovah’s law on the sanctity of life. The Bible declares that life begins at conception, and taking an unborn child’s life is shedding innocent blood, which Jehovah condemns. Respect for life aligns with Jehovah’s standards, guiding decisions to honor Him.</p>
                        <p>Life is sacred.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Psalm 139:16 - “Your eyes even saw me as an embryo; all its parts were written in your book.”</p>
                        <p>Unborn life is valued.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Exodus 21:22, 23 - “If men struggle… and they hurt a pregnant woman… he will pay with soul for soul.”</p>
                        <p>Bloodguilt is serious.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Genesis 9:6 - “Anyone shedding man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed.”</p>
                        <p>God knows life.</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Ancestor worship, venerating or praying to deceased relatives, opposes Jehovah’s commands. The Bible reveals the dead are unconscious, unable to influence the living. Such practices involve spiritism, which Jehovah forbids, as they replace true worship with falsehood. Worship belongs solely to Jehovah.</p>
                        <p>The dead are unconscious.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Ecclesiastes 9:5 - “The dead know nothing at all.”</p>
                        <p>Spiritism is forbidden.</p>

                        <p class="scripture">Exodus 20:3 - “You must not have any other gods besides me.”</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Angels are powerful spirit creatures created by Jehovah long before the physical universe came into existence. These beings reside in the heavens, serving as messengers and executors of God’s will across creation. Unlike humans, they possess no physical form and exist solely as spirits, invisible to the human eye unless Jehovah permits them to materialize. The Bible reveals their vast numbers and diverse roles, from delivering divine messages to protecting the faithful and carrying out judgments against the wicked. Their existence underscores Jehovah’s supreme authority and the organized structure of His heavenly government.</p>
                        <p>The Bible identifies them as spirits, not human souls.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Hebrews 1:14 - “Are they not all spirits for public service, sent out to minister?”</p>
                        <p>History shows angels interacted with humans to deliver God’s messages.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Luke 1:26 - “The angel Gabriel was sent from God.”</p>
                        <p>They are mighty, executing Jehovah’s judgments.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">2 Kings 19:35 - “The angel of Jehovah struck down 185,000.”</p>
                        <p>Science cannot detect them, proving their spirit nature.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Psalm 104:4 - “He makes his angels spirits.”</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The anointed are a select group of 144,000 faithful servants chosen by Jehovah to rule with Christ in heaven, distinct from the majority who hope for earthly life. Called by God’s spirit, they receive a heavenly hope, confirmed at baptism, to serve as kings and priests in His Kingdom. The Bible limits this number, showing their role as a “little flock” amidst a greater crowd of faithful ones. Their anointing began with Jesus’ disciples at Pentecost and continues until the full number is sealed, fulfilling God’s purpose for a heavenly government.</p>
                        <p>The Bible caps their number at 144,000.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Revelation 14:1 - “The Lamb… with 144,000.”</p>
                        <p>They rule with Christ.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Revelation 5:10 - “Made them… priests… reign over the earth.”</p>
                        <p>History ties it to Pentecost.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Acts 2:4 - “Filled with holy spirit.”</p>
                        <p>It’s a heavenly calling.</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The antichrist encompasses those who oppose Jesus Christ and his teachings, denying his role as Jehovah’s appointed King and Savior. The Bible identifies the antichrist not as one person but as individuals and groups spreading false teachings. Loyalty to Jesus protects against such deception.</p>
                        <p>Denies Christ’s role.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">1 John 2:22 - “Who is the liar if it is not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist.”</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Anxiety is a burden Jehovah promises to lift from His servants, offering peace through trust in Him amid this world’s turmoil. The Bible urges us to cast worries on God, who sustains us in trials, as Jesus taught against fretting over daily needs. This relief strengthens us for the ministry, assuring us of His care until the Kingdom ends all distress.</p>
                        <p>It’s cast on Jehovah.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">1 Peter 5:7 - “Throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.”</p>
                        <p>Jesus eased it.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Matthew 6:34 - “Never be anxious about the next day.”</p>
                        <p>History shows trust works.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Psalm 55:22 - “Throw your burden on Jehovah… he will sustain you.”</p>

                        <p>Apostasy is the willful rejection of Jehovah’s truth after knowing it, abandoning true worship through false teachings or disobedience.

                        <p>Apostolic succession, the idea that authority passes through a line of bishops from the apostles, lacks biblical support. The Bible shows the apostles had a unique role, and their authority came from Jehovah, not human succession. True authority rests in God’s Word and His spirit.</p>
                        <p>Apostles were unique.</p>

                        <p>Dress and grooming reflect Jehovah’s standards of modesty and dignity, honoring Him in appearance as His witnesses.

                        <p>Armageddon is the climactic war of Jehovah God, foretold in prophecy as the decisive battle that will end all wickedness on earth. This event is not a random conflict but a deliberate act of divine intervention, orchestrated by Jehovah to destroy Satan’s system and establish His righteous rule. Unlike human wars, which bring chaos and suffering without resolution, Armageddon promises a permanent end to evil, ushering in a new era of peace and justice. It is the culmination of God’s judgment against those who oppose His sovereignty, fulfilling His purpose to cleanse the earth for the meek who will inherit it.</p>
                        <p>The Bible calls it God’s battle, not man’s.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Revelation 16:16 - “They are gathering… to the place… called Armageddon.”</p>

                        <p>Atonement is Jehovah’s provision through Jesus’ ransom to reconcile mankind to Him, removing the stain of Adamic sin. It restores our relationship with God, offering forgiveness and life to those who accept it. Jehovah’s justice and love shine in this act, fulfilled perfectly by Christ’s sacrifice.</p>
                        <p>Atonement bridges the gap sin created.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Romans 5:11 - “We enjoy… reconciliation through our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

                        <p>Jehovah’s authority is the foundation of all existence, establishing Him as the supreme Sovereign over heaven and earth. As the Creator of all things, He alone holds the right to rule, a position unchallenged by any power except Satan’s temporary rebellion. This authority is not arbitrary but rooted in His perfect justice, wisdom, and love, ensuring that all creation operates under His divine order. From the angels in heaven to humans on earth, every being is subject to His will, and even Jesus Christ, His Son, acknowledges Jehovah as the ultimate head. This universal authority will be fully vindicated when God’s Kingdom triumphs over all opposition.</p>
                        <p>The Bible declares Him the Sovereign Ruler.</p>

The Bible reveals it as a harlot, deceiving nations with false teachings and practices. Jehovah calls His people to flee from it to avoid sharing in its destruction.</p>
                        <p>It deceives nations.</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Baptism is far more than a ritual; it is a sacred, public declaration of one’s complete dedication to Jehovah God. Performed by full immersion in water, it symbolizes the washing away of a person’s former life of sin and their commitment to live according to God’s standards. This act follows a thorough understanding of Bible truth and a heartfelt decision to serve Jehovah, distinguishing it from infant sprinkling practiced by many religions. Rooted in the example of Jesus and the early Christians, baptism marks the beginning of a new life devoted to doing God’s will and sharing His message with others.</p>
                        <p>The Bible requires it as a public declaration.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Acts 8:36 - “Look! Here is water; what prevents me from getting baptized?”</p>
                        <p>History confirms early Christians immersed fully.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Matthew 3:16 - “Jesus… came up from the water.”</p>
                        <p>It symbolizes dying to sin.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Romans 6:4 - “Buried with him through our baptism.”</p>

                        <p>Bible study is the diligent pursuit of Jehovah’s truth, vital for spiritual growth and equipping us to teach others His will. It’s a personal and collective effort, as the Bereans showed, building faith and wisdom for these last days. The Bible urges constant meditation on its words, ensuring we stand firm until the Kingdom comes.</p>
                        <p>It’s commanded.</p>

                        <p>Bible translation, per Jehovah’s will, makes His truth accessible, as with the New World Translation (NWT), which restores His name “Jehovah” over 7,000 times and uses modern language for clarity, correcting errors of biased versions like the King James Version (KJV). The KJV, commissioned in 1611 by King James I, retains archaic English, omits God’s name (replacing it with “LORD”), and reflects Trinitarian bias and political influence, distorting scriptures like 1 John 5:7. The NWT counters such corruptions, ensuring accuracy for pure worship today, a task Jehovah’s people uphold until His Kingdom rules.</p>
                        <p>It’s God’s truth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Psalm 119:160 - “The substance of your word is truth.”</p>

                        <p class="scripture">Isaiah 42:8 - “I am Jehovah, that is my name.” - NWT restores ‘Jehovah’ while KJV uses ‘LORD,’ obscuring God’s identity.</p>
                        <p>It demands clarity.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Nehemiah 8:8 - “Reading… giving the meaning.” - NWT’s modern terms aid understanding; KJV’s old English confuses.</p>

                        <p class="scripture">John 17:17 - “Your word is truth.” - NWT removes KJV’s bias, like added words in 1 John 5:7, for true doctrine.</p>

                        <p>Birthdays, widely celebrated today, have no basis in true worship and are rooted in pagan traditions that Jehovah condemns. The Bible mentions only two birthday celebrations, both tied to godless rulers—Pharaoh and Herod—and each linked to violent acts, not godly rejoicing. Historically, these observances stem from superstitions like astrology and the worship of false gods, practices explicitly forbidden in Scripture. True worshipers of Jehovah focus on honoring Him daily, not exalting individuals through annual rituals. By rejecting birthdays, the faithful demonstrate loyalty to God’s standards over human customs.</p>
                        <p>The Bible links them to godless events.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Genesis 40:20 - “Pharaoh’s birthday… he executed the chief baker.”</p>

                        <p>Blood holds a sacred place in Jehovah’s eyes, representing the life He alone gives and sustains. From the time of Noah, God commanded that blood be treated with respect, prohibiting its consumption and misuse, a law reaffirmed for Christians in the first century. This divine standard reflects blood’s unique role as the carrier of life, a truth science confirms but cannot override with human reasoning. Jehovah’s view is clear: blood is not for transfusions or casual use but is reserved for atonement, ultimately fulfilled through Jesus’ sacrifice. Obeying this command honors God’s authority over life itself.</p>
                        <p>The Bible declares it represents life.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Leviticus 17:11 - “The life of the flesh is in the blood.”</p>
                        <p>Early Christians abstained despite pressure.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Acts 15:29 - “Keep abstaining from… blood.”</p>
                        <p>Science affirms its unique role, but Jehovah restricts its use.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Genesis 9:4 - “Flesh with its life—its blood—you must not eat.”</p>
                        <p>Obedience honors Jehovah over human ideas.</p>

                        <p>Christmas, celebrated as Jesus’ birth, is a human invention steeped in pagan traditions, not a command from God. The Bible provides no date for Christ’s birth, and early Christians never observed it, focusing instead on his death as the pivotal event for salvation. Historical evidence ties December 25 to the Roman Saturnalia and sun worship, practices Jehovah explicitly rejects. Customs like trees, gifts, and lights trace back to idolatry, not Scripture. True worshipers honor Jesus by obeying his teachings year-round, not blending truth with falsehood through a holiday God never sanctioned.</p>

                        <p>The conscience is Jehovah’s gift to humans, an inner sense of right and wrong designed to guide moral choices in harmony with His standards. When trained by Bible truth, it acts as a reliable compass, helping one avoid sin and honor God even in private. The Bible warns that an untrained or seared conscience leads to ruin, as seen in this world’s immorality. Christians respect each other’s consciences, balancing personal freedom with love to maintain peace and unity in worship.</p>
                        <p>The Bible says it guides us.</p>

                        <p>Jehovah’s creation of the heavens and earth is a deliberate act of divine power, not a random process. The Bible opens with His purposeful design, bringing order from chaos and life from nothingness over six creative days, each a period of unspecified length. Every detail—from the stars to the smallest organism—reflects His wisdom and intent, crafted to sustain humanity in a perfect home. Unlike evolution’s blind chance, creation reveals a masterful intelligence, fulfilling Jehovah’s will that the earth be inhabited and enjoyed forever by those who honor Him.</p>
                        <p>The Bible states creation was intentional.</p>

                        <p>The idea that Jesus died on a cross is a distortion of truth rooted in pagan symbolism, not Scripture. The Greek word “stauros” used in the Bible refers to an upright stake or pole, not a two-beamed cross, aligning with Roman execution methods of the time. The cross, a pre-Christian idol, was later adopted by false religion to blend pagan beliefs with Christianity, a practice Jehovah abhors. True followers reject this symbol, honoring Jesus’ sacrifice on a stake as the means of ransom, not venerating an object tied to idolatry.</p>
                        <p>The Bible says “stake” (stauros), a single pole.</p>

                        <p>The Bible provides key dates in prophecy, such as 1914, marking Jesus’ enthronement and the last days, calculated from Daniel’s “seven times.” Jehovah reveals these to prepare His people, not for speculation, but to strengthen faith in His Kingdom’s nearness.</p>

                        <p>Death, as defined by Jehovah’s Word, is a state of total unconsciousness, not a transition to an afterlife. The Bible likens it to sleep, where the dead have no awareness, thoughts, or activity, contradicting myths of immortal souls or eternal torment. Introduced through Adam’s sin, death is the penalty for disobedience, but Jehovah offers hope through resurrection, not immediate reward or punishment. This truth exposes pagan lies adopted by false religion, affirming that life’s continuation depends solely on God’s power and promise to restore the dead.</p>
                        <p>The Bible calls it a sleep.</p>

                        <p>Discipline within Jehovah’s congregation is a loving provision to maintain purity and protect the faithful from corrupting influences. When someone persists in serious sin without repentance, the Bible directs their removal from association, a step that mirrors Jehovah’s own justice and mercy. This process, carried out by appointed elders, aims to awaken the wrongdoer to their error while safeguarding the congregation’s spiritual health. Far from being harsh, such discipline reflects God’s desire for all to return to Him, ensuring His people remain a clean vessel for His worship.</p>

                        <p>Divorce, in Jehovah’s eyes, is a serious matter governed by strict standards, permissible only when sexual immorality breaks the marital bond.

While human laws may allow divorce for countless reasons, Jehovah’s law preserves the sanctity of this arrangement, protecting families and honoring His original purpose in Eden.

                        <p>Easter, claimed as a celebration of Jesus’ resurrection, is a pagan festival with no foundation in the Bible. Its customs—eggs, rabbits, and spring rites—trace back to ancient fertility cults, not Christian truth, and the date itself aligns with seasonal pagan festivals rather than Scripture. Early Christians commemorated Jesus’ death, not his resurrection, as the pivotal event for salvation, observing it annually as instructed. Jehovah forbids mixing His worship with idolatrous practices, making Easter a human tradition that true worshipers reject in favor of pure devotion to Him.</p>
                        <p>The Bible omits Easter customs.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Acts 12:4 - “Passover” (not Easter).</p>
                        <p>History ties it to fertility cults.</p>

                        <p>Education, as Jehovah intends, equips individuals to serve Him and live righteously, prioritizing spiritual wisdom over worldly ambition. While practical skills are valuable for sustaining life and supporting the ministry, the pursuit of higher learning often promotes pride and philosophies that oppose God’s truth. The Bible emphasizes knowing Jehovah and His Son as the path to everlasting life, a knowledge far superior to secular accolades. True education molds character, fosters humility, and prepares one to teach others about God’s Kingdom, aligning every effort with His purpose rather than fleeting human goals.</p>
                        <p>The Bible prioritizes godly wisdom.</p>

                        <p>Elders are mature men appointed by holy spirit to shepherd Jehovah’s congregation, upholding His standards and caring for His people.

The Bible outlines their qualifications—humility, faithfulness, and ability to teach—ensuring they lead with love, not dominance.

                        <p>Evolution, the theory that life arose by chance and developed through unguided processes, stands in direct opposition to Jehovah’s act of creation.

Science, when viewed honestly, reveals intricate design in life’s complexity, from DNA to ecosystems, pointing to a deliberate intelligence, not random mutations. Jehovah’s Word and the natural world together affirm that life is a gift from Him, not an accident, and evolution is a human idea that denies His glory as the Maker of all things.</p>

The Bible provides clear roles—husbands as loving heads, wives as supportive helpers, and children as obedient learners—ensuring harmony and strength. This structure, when followed, withstands the pressures of Satan’s world, fostering a home where Jehovah’s principles thrive and prepare all members for everlasting life.</p>

It’s the beginning of wisdom and knowledge, guiding us to please Him in all things. The Bible shows this fear protected faithful ones like Joseph, ensuring Jehovah’s favor and blessings.</p>
                        <p>Fearing Jehovah means despising what He hates.</p>

                        <p>Forgiveness is a cornerstone of Jehovah’s mercy, extended to all who genuinely repent and turn from sin. Made possible through Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, it wipes away the stain of imperfection inherited from Adam, offering a clean standing before God. The Bible reveals Jehovah’s willingness to forgive even grave errors, as seen in His dealings with repentant sinners like David, balancing justice with compassion. This divine gift requires humans to mirror it, forgiving others as a condition of receiving God’s favor, fostering peace and unity among His people.</p>
                        <p>The Bible promises forgiveness through repentance.</p>

                    <p>Free will is Jehovah’s gift to humans, allowing them to choose to serve Him or follow their own desires.

His role as Savior and King of God’s Kingdom makes him the only way to approach Jehovah, a truth affirmed by his flawless life and triumphant resurrection.</p>
                <p>The Bible identifies him as God’s Son.</p>

                <p>He leads us to Jehovah.</p>

                <p>Marriage is a sacred union ordained by Jehovah, uniting one man and one woman in a permanent bond of love and loyalty. Established in Eden, it reflects God’s purpose for companionship and procreation, with each partner fulfilling distinct, complementary roles. The Bible condemns anything that undermines it—like adultery or divorce for trivial reasons—upholding its sanctity as a picture of Christ’s relationship with the congregation. This divine institution thrives when built on mutual respect and devotion to Jehovah, enduring as a foundation for family life into His new world.</p>
                <p>The Bible sets its origin.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Genesis 2:24 - “A man will… stick to his wife.”</p>
                <p>It’s a lasting bond.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Matthew 19:6 - “What God has yoked… let no man put apart.”</p>
                <p>History honors its sanctity.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Hebrews 13:4 - “Let marriage be honorable among all.”</p>
                <p>Love drives it.</p>

                <p>The Mass, a religious ritual reenacting Christ’s sacrifice, lacks biblical basis. The Bible teaches that Jesus’ sacrifice was offered once for all, and true worship involves spiritual devotion, not repetitive ceremonies rooted in human tradition.</p>
                <p>One sacrifice sufficient.</p>

                <p>The Memorial of Jesus’ death is the only celebration commanded in the Bible, instituted by Christ on Nisan 14, the night before his death. It commemorates the ransom that frees us from sin, using bread and wine as symbols of his body and blood.

Jehovah values this quality, promising the mild ones will inherit the earth in His Kingdom.</p>
                <p>Mildness marks Jehovah’s servants distinctly.</p>
                <p class="scripture">Galatians 5:23 - “Fruitage of the spirit is… mildness, self-control.”</p>

It’s not optional but a command, vital for salvation as it warns others before the end comes. This public declaration, often door-to-door, fulfills prophecy and builds faith, offering hope to all who listen. Jehovah blesses this effort, equipping His people to teach truth and make disciples until His purpose is complete.</p>
                <p>The Bible commands preaching.</p>

                <p>Modesty is the humble, unassuming quality Jehovah’s servants cultivate, avoiding showiness in dress, speech, or behavior to honor Him. It reflects a heart focused on spiritual priorities, not self-promotion, aligning with God’s hatred of pride. The Bible urges women and men alike to dress and act in ways that glorify Jehovah, not draw attention to themselves. This trait ensures our conduct supports the ministry and reflects well on God’s name, preparing us for His approval in the new world.</p>
                <p>The Bible calls for humble dress.</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 Timothy 2:9 - “Women adorn themselves in modest apparel.”</p>

                <p>Money is a tool Jehovah’s servants use wisely, prioritizing spiritual riches over material wealth, which often ensnares the heart. The Bible warns against loving money, a root of evil when pursued greedily, as seen in this world’s corruption. True contentment comes from trusting Jehovah’s provision, using resources to support the ministry and help others. This focus ensures we store treasure in heaven, not on earth, aligning with God’s promise of a future free from want.</p>

                <p>Morality, as Jehovah defines it, is living by His righteous standards, rejecting the depravity of Satan’s world in favor of purity and holiness.

The Bible sets clear boundaries—sex within marriage, honest words, and upright deeds—contrasting with today’s moral decay.

This shift honors Jehovah’s new arrangement, focusing on heart devotion over rigid rules.</p>

                <p>Unity is the bond Jehovah’s servants share globally, rooted in love and truth, transcending race or nation, as Jesus prayed for. It’s a hallmark of true worship, achieved through His organization, not human effort. The Bible shows it in the early congregation, a model for us despite Satan’s divisive world. This harmony foreshadows the perfect oneness of God’s Kingdom.</p>
                <p>It’s God’s will.</p>

                <p>Wickedness is willful rebellion against Jehovah’s standards, thriving in Satan’s world through lies, violence, and immorality. It’s the opposite of righteousness, leading to destruction, as seen in the Flood. The Bible urges shunning it, promising God’s judgment will end it at Armageddon. Rejecting wickedness aligns us with Jehovah’s purpose for a pure earth where only the upright dwell.</p>
                <p>It’s rebellion.</p>
