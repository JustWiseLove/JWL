So, too, no one has come to know the things of God except the spirit of God.", explanation: "God’s spirit is His active force, not a person. It reveals His thoughts and purposes, enabling humans to understand divine will, just as a man’s spirit reflects his own mind and intentions." },

This promise assures that God’s rule will replace all corrupt systems, bringing perfect order and peace to His creation." },
                            { text: "Matthew 5:3 - Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.", explanation: "The Kingdom of the heavens is a spiritual realm reserved for the anointed, who recognize their need for God.
