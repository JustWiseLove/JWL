                        <p>Every breath you take is a gift from Jehovah, the one who sparked life itself. No matter what you’ve faced, your existence is proof of his love, a reason to look up with gratitude.</p>
                        <p>The Bible reveals, “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he who made us” (Psalm 100:3). In the beginning, around 4026 BCE, he crafted humanity: “The true God himself made the earth and its inhabitants” (Isaiah 45:18). Your life isn’t random—it’s his design, meant to shine: “Everything he has made pretty in its time” (Ecclesiastes 3:11).</p>
                        <p>Jehovah’s gift outlasts worldly shadows. He formed you to know him, declaring, “I am Jehovah, your Maker” (Isaiah 54:5). Because he gave you life, you’re never alone, as “his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward” (Romans 1:20).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“It is he who made us.” —Psalm 100:3</p>

                        <p>Life isn’t just existence—Jehovah made it to be joyful, shaped for a purpose that lifts your soul. You were created to reflect his beauty and find delight in him.</p>
                        <p>Scripture says, “Rejoice in Jehovah, you righteous ones” (Psalm 97:12). Jehovah designed humans to mirror his love and wisdom: “Jehovah himself gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and discernment” (Proverbs 2:6). He intended life to be rich, as “happy is the people whose God is Jehovah” (Psalm 144:15).</p>
                        <p>Even if joy feels distant, Jehovah’s purpose endures. He invites you to serve him gladly: “Serve Jehovah with rejoicing” (Psalm 100:2). By living for him, you find what life’s meant for, as “the one offering praise glorifies me” (Psalm 50:23).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.” —Psalm 100:2</p>

                        <p>Jehovah doesn’t just give life—he sustains it, filling the earth with gifts to keep you strong. His care shows he values every moment you live.</p>
                        <p>The Bible notes, “He makes grass grow for the cattle, and vegetation for man’s use” (Psalm 104:14). Jehovah’s earth provides: “You open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing” (Psalm 145:16). From harvest to sunrise, he ensures “the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your works” (Psalm 104:13).</p>
                        <p>His grace never falters. When Elijah needed strength, Jehovah sent food: “Get up and eat” (1 Kings 19:5). For you, his provision—seen in nature’s bounty—reminds you life is precious, as “he did good, giving you rains from heaven” (Acts 14:17).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You satisfy the desire of every living thing.” —Psalm 145:16</p>

                        <p>Life thrives when guided by Jehovah’s wisdom. His teachings show you how to live well, making every day a step closer to him.</p>
                        <p>Scripture declares, “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom” (Proverbs 9:10). His commands light the way: “I have come to know that everything the true God does will endure forever” (Ecclesiastes 3:14). Moses learned this, urging, “Apply your hearts to all the words that I am speaking” (Deuteronomy 32:46).</p>
                        <p>Worldly paths confuse, but Jehovah’s truth clarifies. He offers, “If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God” (James 1:5). By studying his Word, you gain life’s direction, as “happy is the man who finds wisdom” (Proverbs 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Happy is the man who finds wisdom.” —Proverbs 3:13</p>

                        <p>Sin could have ended life’s hope, but Jesus’ love changed that. His sacrifice bridges you back to Jehovah, making life eternal possible.</p>
                        <p>Jesus gave everything: “No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his life for his friends” (John 15:13). In 33 CE, he died for us: “By means of him we have the release by ransom” (Ephesians 1:7). His blood restores what Adam lost, as “he who sent me wants me to lose nothing” (John 6:39).</p>
                        <p>Whatever your past, Jesus’ act cleanses: “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20). His love means you’re valued, free to live for Jehovah, as “we have boldness in the presence of God” (1 John 4:17).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“No one has love greater than this.” —John 15:13</p>

                        <p>Life now is precious, but Jehovah offers more—eternal life through Jesus. His promise means death isn’t the end, but a step to forever.</p>
                        <p>Jesus pledged, “This is the will of my Father, that everyone who recognizes the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life” (John 6:40). He showed it, raising Jairus’ daughter: “Little girl, I say to you, get up!” (Mark 5:41). Jehovah’s plan shines: “He will wipe out every tear from their eyes” (Revelation 21:4).</p>
                        <p>This hope fuels you. Like Paul, trust, “The gift God gives is everlasting life” (Romans 6:23). Jesus’ power ensures you’ll live again, as “all those in the tombs will come out” (John 5:28).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Everyone who exercises faith should have everlasting life.” —John 6:40</p>

                        <p>Jehovah gave you life; Jesus saved it. The best response is devotion—living every day to honor the one who made you, not chasing empty praise.</p>
                        <p>The Bible urges, “Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good” (Psalm 106:1). Jesus modeled this: “I seek the will of him who sent me” (John 5:30). Your life can reflect that, as “whatever you do in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus” (Colossians 3:17).</p>
                        <p>Devotion outweighs worldly gain. Choose Jehovah’s way: “The one doing the will of God remains forever” (1 John 2:17). Like Mary, who sat at Jesus’ feet, prioritize him: “Mary chose the good portion” (Luke 10:42).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus.” —Colossians 3:17</p>

                        <p>You’re alive because Jehovah chose it, and Jesus secured it. Thrive in their love, letting faith shape a life that sings their praise, no matter what came before.</p>
                        <p>Jehovah’s love fuels you: “See what sort of love the Father has given us” (1 John 3:1). Jesus prayed, “I made your name known to them” (John 17:26), showing how to live fully. Faith makes life vibrant: “The one who has the Son has this life” (1 John 5:12).</p>
                        <p>Every act—loving, serving—honors your life-giver. Embrace it: “Rejoice and leap for joy” (Luke 6:23). Your faith proves you’re truly alive, as “the righteous one will live by reason of faith” (Hebrews 10:38).</p>
