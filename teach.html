            { title: "1. Why Study the Bible?", instruction: "The Bible stands as Jehovah’s inspired Word, a divine gift distinct from human philosophies or religious texts rooted in false worship, such as pagan myths or materialistic ideologies. It reveals God’s will and purpose for humanity, offering guidance for life’s challenges, as affirmed by 2 Timothy 3:16: 'All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.' Historically, its preservation through centuries—despite attempts to suppress it—demonstrates divine protection. Scientifically, its references, like the earth’s suspension (Job 26:7), align with later discoveries, proving its reliability. Studying it equips us to reject false teachings, like idol worship or soul immortality, and fosters a relationship with Jehovah based on truth.", description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Wisdom and protection from false teachings.", example: "<b>2 Timothy 3:16</b> - All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.\n<b>Joshua 1:8</b> - This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth, and you must read it in an undertone day and night.\n<b>Psalm 119:105</b> - Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light for my path." },
            { title: "2. Who Wrote the Bible?", instruction: "The Bible was penned by over 40 human writers—kings, prophets, fishermen—spanning 1,600 years, yet its unity stems from Jehovah’s holy spirit, as 2 Peter 1:21 states: 'Men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.' Unlike pagan texts filled with contradictory myths, its consistent message across centuries proves divine authorship. Historically, its composition began with Moses around 1513 B.C.E. and concluded with John’s writings around 98 C.E., surviving persecution and translation into thousands of languages. Science supports its accuracy, such as the hydrologic cycle in Job 36:27-28, predating modern understanding. This refutes false worship’s claim of human origin, affirming Jehovah as its true Author.", description: "<b>History:</b> Unified over 1,600 years.", example: "<b>2 Peter 1:21</b> - Men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.\n<b>2 Timothy 3:16</b> - All Scripture is inspired of God.\n<b>Isaiah 40:8</b> - The word of our God endures forever." },
            { title: "3. Is the Bible Scientifically Accurate?", instruction: "The Bible’s scientific accuracy shines through statements made long before human discovery, such as Job 26:7: 'He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.' This aligns with the earth’s suspension in space, a fact unknown in ancient times. Unlike false worship’s flat-earth myths or Babylonian cosmologies, Isaiah 40:22 describes Jehovah as 'the One who dwells above the circle of the earth,' hinting at its spherical shape. Historically, its sanitation laws (Leviticus 11-15) predate germ theory, saving lives. These facts dismantle claims of inaccuracy, proving the Bible’s divine origin and its superiority over pagan falsehoods.", description: "<b>Science:</b> Earth’s shape and suspension.", example: "<b>Job 26:7</b> - He suspends the earth upon nothing.\n<b>Isaiah 40:22</b> - He dwells above the circle of the earth.\n<b>Job 36:27-28</b> - He draws up the drops of water; they filter as rain." },
            { title: "4. What Is God’s Name?", instruction: "Jehovah, God’s personal name, appears over 7,000 times in the original texts, as Psalm 83:18 declares: 'You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.' False worship obscures this name with titles like 'Lord,' a practice rooted in superstition and tradition, not Scripture. Historically, the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) was revered by Israel, yet removed by later scribes influenced by pagan customs. Science offers no contradiction, but the Bible’s consistent use across millennia confirms its authenticity. Knowing Jehovah’s name sets true worship apart from the nameless deities of false religion.", description: "<b>Origin:</b> YHWH, often removed.", example: "<b>Psalm 83:18</b> - You, whose name is Jehovah, are the Most High.\n<b>Exodus 3:15</b> - Jehovah... this is my name forever.\n<b>Isaiah 42:8</b> - I am Jehovah. That is my name." },
            { title: "5. Who Is Jesus Christ?", instruction: "Jesus Christ is Jehovah’s firstborn Son, not God Almighty, as Colossians 1:15 states: 'He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.' False worship, like the Trinity doctrine from pagan triads, equates him with Jehovah, but Scripture distinguishes them. Historically, Jesus’ role as Messiah was foretold (Isaiah 9:6) and fulfilled in 29 C.E., initiating Christianity. Science aligns with his miracles, like healing, as acts of divine power, not myth. He’s the ransom and future King, refuting false claims of co-equality and affirming Jehovah’s supremacy in true worship.", description: "<b>Role:</b> Son and Savior.", example: "<b>Colossians 1:15</b> - The firstborn of all creation.\n<b>John 3:16</b> - God gave his only-begotten Son.\n<b>1 Timothy 2:5</b> - One God, and one mediator, Christ Jesus." },
            { title: "6. What Is the Holy Spirit?", instruction: "The holy spirit is Jehovah’s active force, not a person, as Genesis 1:2 reveals: 'God’s active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.' False worship’s Trinity portrays it as a deity, borrowing from pagan trios like Egypt’s Osiris-Isis-Horus, but the Bible shows it as God’s power at work. Historically, it inspired prophets and empowered Jesus’ miracles (Luke 4:1). Scientifically, its effects—like creation’s order—suggest a purposeful force, not a random entity. Understanding this counters false teachings and honors Jehovah’s true nature.", description: "<b>Use:</b> God’s power.", example: "<b>Genesis 1:2</b> - God’s active force was moving.\n<b>Job 26:13</b> - By his spirit the heavens were made.\n<b>Luke 4:1</b> - Jesus, full of holy spirit." },
            { title: "7. Why Did God Create the Earth?", instruction: "Jehovah created the earth as a permanent home for humanity, as Isaiah 45:18 affirms: 'He is the One who formed the earth... who firmly established it, who did not create it simply for nothing, but formed it to be inhabited.' False worship teaches a temporary earth or soul ascension, echoing pagan afterlife myths, but the Bible promises an eternal paradise. Historically, Genesis records this purpose from creation’s start. Science supports an earth designed for life—its water, air, and ecosystems—refuting chance. This truth inspires hope in Jehovah’s original plan.", description: "<b>Purpose:</b> A lasting home.", example: "<b>Psalm 104:5</b> - The earth will not be moved forever.\n<b>Isaiah 45:18</b> - He formed it to be inhabited.\n<b>Genesis 1:28</b> - Fill the earth and subdue it." },
            { title: "8. What Is Sin?", instruction: "Sin is any act or thought that misses Jehovah’s perfect standards, inherited from Adam, as Romans 3:23 states: 'All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.' False worship minimizes sin with rituals or excuses, like pagan sacrifices to appease gods, but the Bible calls it rebellion against Jehovah. Historically, sin entered through Adam’s disobedience in Eden (Genesis 3). Science shows human imperfection—disease and death—as sin’s effects, not evolution’s design. Recognizing sin’s gravity drives us to seek Jehovah’s forgiveness, not human solutions.", description: "<b>Origin:</b> Rebellion against God.", example: "<b>Romans 3:23</b> - All have sinned.\n<b>Genesis 3:6</b> - She took some of its fruit and ate.\n<b>1 John 3:4</b> - Sin is lawlessness." },
            { title: "9. Why Do We Die?", instruction: "Death results from sin, not Jehovah’s original intent, as Romans 5:12 explains: 'Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin.' False worship’s soul immortality, rooted in Babylonian and Greek myths, contradicts this, but the Bible promises death’s end (1 Corinthians 15:26). Historically, Adam’s sin in 4026 B.C.E. (per Bible chronology) introduced mortality. Science confirms death as universal, unlike false claims of eternal consciousness. Jehovah’s purpose to eliminate death offers hope beyond pagan lies.", description: "<b>History:</b> From Adam’s sin.", example: "<b>Romans 5:12</b> - Death spread to all men.\n<b>Romans 6:23</b> - The wages sin pays is death.\n<b>1 Corinthians 15:26</b> - Death is to be brought to nothing." },
            { title: "10. What Is the Soul?", instruction: "The soul is the living person—body and breath—not an immortal entity, as Genesis 2:7 states: 'Jehovah God went on to form the man... and the man became a living soul.' False worship’s spirit survival, from Egyptian and Hindu beliefs, clashes with Ezekiel 18:4: 'The soul who sins is the one who will die.' Historically, this truth shaped Israel’s rejection of afterlife myths. Science shows life ceases without breath or blood, aligning with Scripture, not paganism. This clarifies Jehovah’s resurrection hope over false immortality.", description: "<b>Science:</b> Life ends without breath.", example: "<b>Genesis 2:7</b> - The man became a living soul.\n<b>Ezekiel 18:4</b> - The soul who sins will die.\n<b>Ecclesiastes 9:10</b> - No work in the Grave." },
            { title: "11. What Is False Worship?", instruction: "False worship defies Jehovah’s standards through idolatry and human traditions, as 1 John 5:21 warns: 'Guard yourselves from idols.' Unlike true worship, it includes pagan practices like statue veneration or polytheism, condemned in Exodus 20:4-5. Historically, Israel battled Canaanite idol worship, a struggle echoed today in religious syncretism. Science exposes idols as powerless—mere stone or wood—while the Bible’s God creates and sustains life. Rejecting false worship aligns us with Jehovah’s exclusive glory.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Defies God’s exclusivity.", example: "<b>1 John 5:21</b> - Guard yourselves from idols.\n<b>Exodus 20:4-5</b> - You must not bow down to them.\n<b>Deuteronomy 4:39</b> - Jehovah is the true God." },
            { title: "12. What Is Prayer?", instruction: "Prayer is personal communication with Jehovah, not rote chants or idol pleas, as Philippians 4:6 instructs: 'In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.' False worship uses repetitive formulas or intermediaries, like pagan priests, but Jesus taught direct access (John 16:23). Historically, faithful ones like Daniel prayed sincerely, not ritually. Science shows prayer’s calming effect, supporting its purpose in building faith. True prayer strengthens our bond with Jehovah, free of false traditions.", description: "<b>Purpose:</b> Connection with Jehovah.", example: "<b>Philippians 4:6</b> - Let your petitions be made known.\n<b>Matthew 6:7</b> - Do not say the same things over.\n<b>John 16:23</b> - Ask the Father in my name." },
            { title: "13. Why Have Faith?", instruction: "Faith is confident trust in Jehovah’s promises, not blind superstition, as Hebrews 11:6 states: 'Without faith it is impossible to please God well.' False worship relies on luck or omens, like Babylonian astrology, but Bible faith rests on evidence—fulfilled prophecies and creation’s design (Romans 1:20). Historically, Noah’s faith saved his family, a pattern for us. Science marvels at the universe’s order, bolstering faith in a purposeful Creator. Faith in Jehovah’s Word offers hope beyond pagan uncertainties.", description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Hope in truth.", example: "<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - Without faith it is impossible.\n<b>Romans 10:17</b> - Faith follows the thing heard.\n<b>Hebrews 11:1</b> - Faith is the assured expectation." },
            { title: "14. What Is Baptism?", instruction: "Baptism is a public symbol of dedication to Jehovah, not a ritual for infants, as Acts 2:38 commands: 'Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.' False worship sprinkles babies, a tradition from pagan rites, but the Bible requires conscious faith and full immersion (Matthew 3:16). Historically, early Christians baptized believers, not newborns. Science shows immersion’s symbolism—death to sin, new life—mirrors natural cycles. Baptism marks true worshipers committed to Jehovah.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Conscious decision.", example: "<b>Acts 2:38</b> - Repent, and be baptized.\n<b>Matthew 3:16</b> - Jesus came up from the water.\n<b>Acts 8:36</b> - What prevents me from getting baptized?" },
            { title: "15. Why Obey God?", instruction: "Obedience to Jehovah reflects love and brings blessings, as 1 John 5:3 explains: 'This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.' False worship follows human rules or lax morality, like pagan permissiveness, but the Bible ties obedience to life (Deuteronomy 11:27). Historically, Israel prospered when obedient, a lesson for today. Science links discipline to well-being, echoing Jehovah’s laws. Obeying Him ensures protection from false paths.", description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Blessings from God.", example: "<b>1 John 5:3</b> - This is what the love of God means.\n<b>Deuteronomy 11:27</b> - Blessing if you listen.\n<b>John 14:15</b> - If you love me, observe my commandments." },
            { title: "16. What Is Love?", instruction: "Love mirrors Jehovah’s nature, a selfless action, not mere emotion, as 1 John 4:8 declares: 'God is love.' False worship distorts love into lust or ritual, like pagan fertility cults, but the Bible defines it through sacrifice—Jesus’ death (John 3:16). Historically, early Christians showed love by sharing all things (Acts 2:44-45). Science links love to health, reflecting Jehovah’s design. True love honors Him, not worldly desires.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Love is action.", example: "<b>1 John 4:8</b> - God is love.\n<b>John 3:16</b> - God gave his only-begotten Son.\n<b>1 Corinthians 13:4</b> - Love is patient and kind." },
            { title: "17. Why Be Honest?", instruction: "Honesty reflects Jehovah’s truthfulness, as Ephesians 4:25 urges: 'Speak truth each one of you with his neighbor.' False worship thrives on deceit, like pagan oracles’ vague lies, but the Bible demands integrity. Historically, honest dealings marked God’s servants, like Joseph in Egypt. Science shows trust builds societies, aligning with Jehovah’s principles. Honesty honors Him, rejecting falsehood’s corruption.", description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Reflects God’s character.", example: "<b>Ephesians 4:25</b> - Speak truth with his neighbor.\n<b>Proverbs 12:22</b> - Lying lips are detestable.\n<b>Psalm 15:2</b> - Speaking the truth in his heart." },
            { title: "18. What Is the Family?", instruction: "The family is Jehovah’s arrangement for love and order, as Ephesians 5:23 states: 'A husband is head of his wife as the Christ is head of the congregation.' False worship distorts this with polygamy or matriarchy, like pagan goddess cults, but the Bible upholds one man, one woman (Genesis 2:24). Historically, the family unit sustained Israel’s faith. Science confirms stable families benefit society, reflecting Jehovah’s design. It’s a foundation for true worship.", description: "<b>Purpose:</b> Love and order.", example: "<b>Ephesians 5:23</b> - A husband is head of his wife.\n<b>Colossians 3:18-19</b> - Wives, be in subjection; husbands, love.\n<b>Proverbs 22:6</b> - Train a boy in the way." },
            { title: "19. Why Respect Authority?", instruction: "Respecting authority maintains Jehovah’s order, as Romans 13:1 instructs: 'Let every person be in subjection to the superior authorities.' False worship rebels or deifies rulers, like Roman emperor worship, but the Bible balances obedience unless it defies God (Acts 5:29).

What Is the Great Tribulation?", instruction: "The Great Tribulation is a time of unprecedented distress before Jehovah’s day, as Matthew 24:21 warns: 'There will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning.' False worship predicts random doom, like pagan apocalypses, but the Bible protects the righteous (Revelation 7:14). Historically, Noah’s day prefigured it.

Who Are the 144,000?", instruction: "The 144,000 are a select group chosen to rule with Christ in heaven, as Revelation 14:3 states: 'The 144,000 who have been bought from the earth.' False worship misapplies this to all, like universalist myths, but the Bible limits it to a little flock (Luke 12:32). Historically, they began being sealed post-33 C.E.

            { title: "65. What Is the Mark of the Beast?", instruction: "The mark of the beast symbolizes opposition to Jehovah, as Revelation 13:16 warns: 'It puts under compulsion all people... that they should give them a mark.' False worship aligns with Satan’s system, like pagan loyalty oaths, but the Bible calls for God’s mark (Deuteronomy 6:8). Historically, apostates bore this mark spiritually.

            { title: "66. Why No Clergy Class?", instruction: "Jehovah’s people reject a clergy class, as Matthew 23:8 states: 'All of you are brothers.' False worship elevates priests, like pagan hierarchies, but the Bible equalizes all in service (1 Peter 5:3). Historically, early Christians had no clergy, only elders. Science shows equality fosters unity, reflecting Jehovah’s will over human titles.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Equality in service.", example: "<b>Matthew 23:8</b> - All of you are brothers.\n<b>1 Peter 5:3</b> - Not lording it over.\n<b>John 13:14</b> - Wash one another’s feet." },

False worship relies on icons, like pagan statues, but the Bible demands spirit and truth (John 4:24). Historically, Israel purged idols for Jehovah.

False worship offers empty hopes, like pagan utopias, but the Bible solves earth’s woes (Isaiah 52:7). Historically, it spread post-33 C.E., accelerating in 1914.

            { title: "70. Why No War?", instruction: "Jehovah’s people reject war, as Isaiah 2:4 prophesies: 'They will beat their swords into plowshares.' False worship glorifies conflict, like Mars worship, but the Bible awaits Kingdom peace (John 18:36). Historically, Christians refused Rome’s battles. Science links war to ruin, contrasting Jehovah’s way.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Peace is God’s way.", example: "<b>Isaiah 2:4</b> - Beat swords into plowshares.\n<b>Matthew 26:52</b> - Perish by the sword.\n<b>John 18:36</b> - My Kingdom is no part of this world." },
            { title: "71. What Is the Soul’s Destiny?", instruction: "The soul’s destiny is death then resurrection, as Ezekiel 18:4 states: 'The soul who sins is the one who will die.' False worship claims eternal life elsewhere, like Greek shades, but the Bible promises restoration (John 5:28). Historically, this hope sustained faithful ones. Science confirms death’s end, aligning with Jehovah’s plan.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Resurrection, not immortality.", example: "<b>Ezekiel 18:4</b> - Soul who sins will die.\n<b>John 5:28</b> - Tombs will come out.\n<b>Ecclesiastes 9:5</b> - Dead know nothing." },
            { title: "72. Why No Soul Immortality?", instruction: "Soul immortality is a lie, as Ecclesiastes 9:5 states: 'The dead know nothing at all.' False worship, from Babylon’s spirit tales, contradicts Genesis 3:19: 'To dust you will return.' Historically, early Christians rejected it. Science shows life ends at death, proving Jehovah’s resurrection over pagan myths.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Not innate.", example: "<b>Ecclesiastes 9:5</b> - Dead know nothing.\n<b>Genesis 3:19</b> - To dust you will return.\n<b>1 Timothy 6:16</b> - He alone has immortality." },

What Is Prophecy?", instruction: "Prophecy is Jehovah’s revealed plan, as Amos 3:7 states: 'The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will not do a thing unless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants the prophets.' False worship trusts soothsayers, like Delphi’s oracle, but the Bible’s predictions, like Babylon’s fall, prove true (Isaiah 46:10). Historically, fulfilled prophecy marks Jehovah’s control. Science can’t predict with such precision.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> God’s purpose.", example: "<b>Amos 3:7</b> - Revealed to his prophets.\n<b>Isaiah 46:10</b> - End from the beginning.\n<b>2 Peter 1:19</b> - Prophetic word made sure." },
            { title: "74. Why No Christmas?", instruction: "Christmas stems from pagan Saturnalia, not Scripture, as Luke 22:19 focuses on Jesus’ death: 'Keep doing this in remembrance of me.' False worship blends it with Christ, but the Bible rejects such customs (Jeremiah 10:2-4). Historically, it emerged post-4th century C.E., not from apostles. Science traces its roots to winter rites, not Jehovah’s truth.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Not Christian.", example: "<b>Luke 22:19</b> - In remembrance of me.\n<b>Jeremiah 10:2-4</b> - Customs of the peoples are delusion.\n<b>Matthew 15:9</b> - Teach commands of men." },
            { title: "75. What Is the New Covenant?", instruction: "The new covenant is Jehovah’s pact with the 144,000, as Jeremiah 31:31 promises: 'I will make a new covenant.' False worship misapplies it universally, like pagan pacts, but the Bible limits it to Christ’s co-rulers (Luke 22:20). Historically, it began in 33 C.E. Science can’t grasp its spiritual scope, but Jehovah’s Word defines it.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Specific group.", example: "<b>Jeremiah 31:31</b> - A new covenant.\n<b>Luke 22:20</b> - New covenant by my blood.\n<b>Hebrews 8:10</b> - Covenant with Israel." },
            { title: "76. Why No Easter?", instruction: "Easter mixes pagan Eostre rites with Jesus’ resurrection, unlike 1 Corinthians 11:25: 'Keep doing this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.' False worship adopts it, but the Bible sticks to Passover (Deuteronomy 12:30). Historically, it’s post-apostolic, not Christian. Science traces its fertility symbols, not Jehovah’s truth.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Pagan roots.", example: "<b>1 Corinthians 11:25</b> - In remembrance of me.\n<b>Acts 12:4</b> - [Passover, not Easter].\n<b>Deuteronomy 12:30</b> - Not inquire about their gods." },
            { title: "77. What Is Babylon the Great?", instruction: "Babylon the Great represents the global empire of false religion, as Revelation 17:5 identifies it: 'Babylon the Great, the mother of the prostitutes and of the disgusting things of the earth.' Unlike Jehovah’s pure worship, it blends pagan practices—like idol worship and spiritism—with distorted Christian teachings, misleading nations (Revelation 18:4). Historically, it traces back to ancient Babylon’s polytheism, which spread worldwide, influencing even modern holidays. Science exposes its rituals as baseless, while the Bible’s call to 'get out of her' proves Jehovah’s judgment looms over this counterfeit system.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Global false worship.", example: "<b>Revelation 17:5</b> - Babylon the Great.\n<b>Revelation 18:4</b> - Come out of her.\n<b>Jeremiah 51:6</b> - Flee from Babylon." },
            { title: "78. What Is the Paradise Earth?", instruction: "The paradise earth is Jehovah’s promise of a restored planet, as Matthew 5:5 declares: 'Happy are the mild-tempered, for they will inherit the earth.' False worship envisions heaven or reincarnation, like Hindu cycles, but the Bible restores Eden’s perfection—peace among animals and humans (Isaiah 11:6). Historically, this hope sustained faithful ones like Abraham. Science marvels at earth’s life-supporting design, hinting at Jehovah’s intent to renew it, not abandon it to pagan chaos.", description: "<b>Future:</b> Perfect earth.", example: "<b>Matthew 5:5</b> - Meek will inherit the earth.\n<b>Isaiah 11:6</b> - Wolf will reside with lamb.\n<b>Revelation 21:4</b> - Death will be no more." },
            { title: "79. Why No Blood Transfusions?", instruction: "Blood is sacred to Jehovah, reserved for atonement, as Acts 15:29 commands: 'Keep abstaining from... blood.' False worship profanes it, like pagan blood-drinking rites, but the Bible upholds its sanctity from Noah’s day (Genesis 9:4). Historically, early Christians died rather than violate this law. Science offers alternatives like saline, affirming Jehovah’s wisdom over human fixes that defy His will.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> God’s law on blood.", example: "<b>Acts 15:29</b> - Abstain from blood.\n<b>Genesis 9:4</b> - Flesh with its blood you must not eat.\n<b>Leviticus 17:14</b> - Blood is the life." },
            { title: "80. What Is the Faithful Slave?", instruction: "The faithful slave is a group appointed by Jesus to provide spiritual food, as Matthew 24:45 asks: 'Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time?' False worship elevates clergy or mystics, like pagan oracles, but the Bible assigns this role to a collective serving Jehovah’s people (Luke 12:42-44). Historically, this slave emerged clearly in the last days, post-1914, feeding truth. Science can’t replicate spiritual nourishment, but Jehovah’s provision through them strengthens His worshipers.", description: "<b>Role:</b> Spiritual providers.", example: "<b>Matthew 24:45</b> - Faithful and discreet slave.\n<b>Luke 12:42</b> - Appointed over domestics.\n<b>John 21:17</b> - Feed my little sheep." },
            { title: "81. Why No Political Involvement?", instruction: "Jehovah’s people avoid politics, as John 17:16 states: 'They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.' False worship entangles with rulers, like Rome’s state religion, but the Bible pledges loyalty to God’s Kingdom alone (John 18:36). Historically, early Christians refused political roles, facing death. Science shows politics divide, while Jehovah’s unity prevails.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Loyalty to God’s rule.", example: "<b>John 17:16</b> - No part of the world.\n<b>John 18:36</b> - My Kingdom is not of this world.\n<b>James 4:4</b> - Friendship with the world is enmity." },
            { title: "82. What Is the Sign of the Last Days?", instruction: "The sign of the last days includes wars, earthquakes, and lawlessness, as Matthew 24:7-8 warns: 'Nation will rise against nation... all these things are a beginning of pangs of distress.' False worship predicts vague ends, like pagan omens, but the Bible’s composite sign began in 1914 (2 Timothy 3:1-5). Science tracks these trends, confirming Jehovah’s timeline over human guesses.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Visible signs.", example: "<b>Matthew 24:7-8</b> - Nation against nation.\n<b>Luke 21:11</b> - Great earthquakes.\n<b>2 Timothy 3:1-5</b> - Critical times hard to deal with." },
            { title: "83. Why No Trinity?", instruction: "The Trinity contradicts Jehovah’s oneness, as Deuteronomy 6:4 declares: 'Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.' False worship imports it from pagan triads, like Egypt’s Osiris-Isis-Horus, but the Bible keeps God distinct from Jesus (John 14:28). Historically, it was forced at Nicaea in 325 C.E., not from Scripture. Science finds no three-in-one, affirming Jehovah’s truth.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Not Biblical.", example: "<b>Deuteronomy 6:4</b> - Jehovah is one.\n<b>John 14:28</b> - The Father is greater than I.\n<b>1 Corinthians 8:6</b> - One God, the Father." },
            { title: "84. What Is Everlasting Life?", instruction: "Everlasting life is Jehovah’s gift of endless existence, as John 17:3 promises: 'This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you.' False worship offers reincarnation or torment, like Hindu cycles, but the Bible gives paradise hope (Titus 1:2). Historically, this promise drove faithful ones like Daniel. Science can’t grant it, but Jehovah will.", description: "<b>Future:</b> Endless life.", example: "<b>John 17:3</b> - Everlasting life through knowledge.\n<b>Titus 1:2</b> - Hope of everlasting life.\n<b>Revelation 21:4</b> - Death will be no more." },

Why No Halloween?", instruction: "Halloween stems from pagan Samhain, not Jehovah’s worship, as Deuteronomy 18:10-11 forbids: 'There should not be found in you anyone who... consults the dead.' False worship embraces spiritism, but the Bible rejects such customs (Galatians 4:9-10). Historically, it’s tied to Druid rites, not Christ. Science debunks spirit contact, aligning with Jehovah’s truth.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Pagan origin.", example: "<b>Deuteronomy 18:10-11</b> - Not consult the dead.\n<b>1 Corinthians 10:20</b> - Not share with demons.\n<b>Galatians 4:9-10</b> - Weak and beggarly things." },
            { title: "86. What Is the Final Test?", instruction: "The final test follows Satan’s release after 1,000 years, as Revelation 20:7-8 states: 'Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to mislead the nations.' False worship ignores this, like pagan endless cycles, but the Bible predicts a last stand of loyalty (Revelation 20:10). Historically, tests like Eden’s recur. Science can’t foresee it, but Jehovah prepares us.", description: "<b>Future:</b> Loyalty proven.", example: "<b>Revelation 20:7-8</b> - Satan released to mislead.\n<b>Revelation 20:10</b> - Devil hurled into the lake.\n<b>1 Corinthians 10:13</b> - God provides escape." },
            { title: "87. Why No Mother Worship?", instruction: "Mother worship, like Mary veneration, lacks Bible basis, as Exodus 20:3 commands: 'You must not have any other gods besides me.' False worship adopts goddess cults, like Isis or Gaia, but the Bible exalts Jehovah alone (Isaiah 42:8). Historically, this crept in post-apostles. Science shows idols as powerless, affirming Jehovah’s supremacy.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> God alone.", example: "<b>Exodus 20:3</b> - No other gods.\n<b>Isaiah 42:8</b> - My glory to no one else.\n<b>Matthew 4:10</b> - Worship Jehovah your God." },
            { title: "88. What Is the Day of Jehovah?", instruction: "The Day of Jehovah is His time of judgment, as Zephaniah 1:14 warns: 'The great day of Jehovah is near.' False worship fears random doom, like pagan floods, but the Bible targets wickedness, sparing the righteous (2 Peter 3:7). Historically, past days like Noah’s foreshadow it. Science notes chaos, but Jehovah’s order prevails.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Judgment day.", example: "<b>Zephaniah 1:14</b> - Day of Jehovah is near.\n<b>2 Peter 3:7</b> - Heavens and earth for fire.\n<b>Joel 2:31</b> - Great and fear-inspiring day." },
            { title: "89. Why No Cross Worship?", instruction: "The cross isn’t a Christian symbol but a pagan one, as Deuteronomy 7:5 commands: 'Tear down their altars.' False worship adopted it from Rome’s tau and Egypt’s ankh, but Jesus died on a stake (Galatians 3:13). Historically, it entered post-300 C.E., not from apostles. Science shows stakes, not crosses, were used, aligning with Jehovah’s truth.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Not Biblical.", example: "<b>Deuteronomy 7:5</b> - Tear down their altars.\n<b>Galatians 3:13</b> - Hung on a stake.\n<b>John 19:17</b> - Carrying the torture stake." },
            { title: "90. What Is the Little Flock?", instruction: "The little flock is the 144,000 chosen for heaven, as Luke 12:32 states: 'Have no fear, little flock, for your Father has approved of giving you the Kingdom.' False worship applies it to all, like universalist myths, but the Bible distinguishes them from the great crowd (Revelation 7:9). Historically, they were sealed post-33 C.E. Science can’t grasp this, but Jehovah reveals it.", description: "<b>Role:</b> Heavenly rulers.", example: "<b>Luke 12:32</b> - Little flock given the Kingdom.\n<b>Revelation 14:1</b> - 144,000 with the Lamb.\n<b>Revelation 7:9</b> - Great crowd before the throne." },
            { title: "91. Why No Infant Baptism?", instruction: "Infant baptism lacks Bible support, as Acts 8:36-38 shows: 'Look! A body of water; what prevents me from getting baptized?'—requiring faith first. False worship sprinkles babies, like pagan rites, but the Bible demands conscious dedication (Mark 16:16). Historically, it began post-apostles. Science shows babies can’t decide, affirming Jehovah’s way.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Faith precedes.", example: "<b>Acts 8:36-38</b> - Believed, then baptized.\n<b>Mark 16:16</b> - He that believes and is baptized.\n<b>Matthew 28:19</b> - Make disciples, then baptize." },
            { title: "92. What Is the Great Crowd?", instruction: "The great crowd survives Armageddon to live on earth, as Revelation 7:9 describes: 'A great crowd, which no man was able to number... standing before the throne.' False worship ignores this, like afterlife myths, but the Bible pairs them with the 144,000 (Revelation 7:14). Historically, this hope grew in the last days. Science can’t count them, but Jehovah knows.", description: "<b>Future:</b> Earthly hope.", example: "<b>Revelation 7:9</b> - Great crowd before the throne.\n<b>Revelation 7:14</b> - Come out of tribulation.\n<b>Psalm 37:29</b> - Righteous will possess the earth." },
            { title: "93. Why No Hellfire?", instruction: "Hellfire contradicts Jehovah’s love, as Ecclesiastes 9:5 states: 'The dead know nothing at all.' False worship borrows it from Babylon’s fires, but the Bible shows death as sleep (John 11:11). Historically, early Christians rejected torment. Science confirms no consciousness in death, proving Jehovah’s justice over pagan fear.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Not Biblical.", example: "<b>Ecclesiastes 9:5</b> - Dead know nothing.\n<b>Psalm 146:4</b> - His thoughts perish.\n<b>John 11:11</b> - Lazarus has fallen asleep." },
            { title: "94. What Is the Tree of Life?", instruction: "The tree of life symbolizes eternal life from Jehovah, as Genesis 2:9 states: 'The tree of life in the middle of the garden.' False worship twists it into myths, like pagan immortality trees, but the Bible ties it to paradise restored (Revelation 22:2). Historically, Eden’s loss awaits reversal. Science can’t replicate it, but Jehovah will.", description: "<b>Future:</b> Life restored.", example: "<b>Genesis 2:9</b> - Tree of life in the garden.\n<b>Revelation 22:2</b> - Tree of life for healing.\n<b>Proverbs 3:18</b> - Wisdom a tree of life." },
            { title: "95. Why No Purgatory?", instruction: "Purgatory is a false teaching, not in Scripture, as Hebrews 9:27 states: 'It is reserved for men to die once for all time, and after this a judgment.' False worship invents it from pagan cleansing myths, but the Bible offers resurrection, not purging (John 5:28-29). Historically, it emerged post-apostles. Science denies post-death purging, affirming Jehovah’s truth.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Not Biblical.", example: "<b>Hebrews 9:27</b> - Die once, then judgment.\n<b>John 5:28-29</b> - Resurrection from tombs.\n<b>Luke 16:26</b> - Great gulf fixed." },

Science can’t measure it, but Jehovah’s plan unfolds.", description: "<b>Future:</b> Earth’s renewal.", example: "<b>Revelation 20:4</b> - Ruled for 1,000 years.\n<b>Revelation 20:6</b> - Priests of God and Christ.\n<b>Isaiah 65:20</b> - No more infant dying." },
            { title: "97. Why No Reincarnation?", instruction: "Reincarnation contradicts Jehovah’s plan, as Hebrews 9:27 states: 'It is reserved for men to die once for all time.'

            { title: "98. What Is the Lake of Fire?", instruction: "The lake of fire is total destruction, not torment, as Revelation 20:14 states: 'Death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This means the second death.' False worship sees it as hell, like pagan fires, but the Bible equates it with annihilation (Malachi 4:1). Historically, Sodom’s end prefigured it. Science confirms destruction, not eternal pain, aligning with Jehovah’s justice.", description: "<b>Fact:</b> Second death.", example: "<b>Revelation 20:14</b> - Lake of fire is second death.\n<b>Malachi 4:1</b> - Wicked burned up.\n<b>Matthew 10:28</b> - Destroy both soul and body." },

Why No Universal Salvation?", instruction: "Universal salvation defies Jehovah’s justice, as Matthew 7:13-14 warns: 'Narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are finding it.'
