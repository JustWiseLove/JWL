                            <p>1. Current events and attitudes indicate a change is near.—Matt. 24:3, 7, 8; Luke 21:10, 11; 2 Tim. 3:1-5.</p>
                            <p>The Bible’s description of the last days matches what we see today—wars, famines, earthquakes, and a rise in lawlessness. These events, combined with a global preaching work, fulfill Jesus’ prophecy about the sign of his presence. Attitudes have also shifted, with many becoming lovers of themselves, money, and pleasure rather than lovers of God, showing a decline in moral values as foretold.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: 'Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?' ... 'For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another. All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress.'" - Matthew 24:3, 7, 8</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"Then he said to them: 'Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another food shortages and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and from heaven great signs.'" - Luke 21:10, 11</p>

                            <p>2. The earth will never be destroyed.—Ps. 104:5; Eccl. 1:4.</p>
                            <p>God created the earth to be a permanent home for humans. His purpose has not changed, even with the challenges we face today. The Scriptures emphasize that the earth will remain, and God will ensure it is a suitable dwelling place for those who love him, fulfilling his original intention for mankind to live on it forever.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"He has established the earth on its foundations; it will not be moved from its place forever and ever." - Psalm 104:5</p>

                            <p>3. The earth’s environment will be restored.—Isa. 35:1, 2; Rev. 11:18.</p>
                            <p>The Bible describes a time when deserts will blossom and streams will flow in dry lands, a stark contrast to today’s environmental degradation. God will also hold accountable those who ruin the earth, ensuring that his creation is healed and restored to its intended beauty for the enjoyment of those who live under his Kingdom.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"The wilderness and the parched land will exult, and the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron. It will blossom profusely and also rejoice with joy and shouting. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of Jehovah, the splendor of our God." - Isaiah 35:1, 2</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time came for the dead to be judged and to reward your slaves the prophets and the holy ones and those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth." - Revelation 11:18</p>

                            <p>4. Everyone will have perfect health.—Isa. 33:24; 35:5, 6.</p>
                            <p>Under God’s Kingdom, the effects of sin, including sickness, will be removed. The blind will see, the deaf will hear, and the lame will walk, as the Bible promises. This restoration of health will allow people to enjoy life to the full, free from the pain and limitations that afflict humanity today.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"And no resident will say: 'I am sick.' The people dwelling in the land will be pardoned for their error." - Isaiah 33:24</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"At that time the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped. At that time the lame will leap like a deer, and the tongue of the speechless will shout for joy. For waters will burst forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert plain." - Isaiah 35:5, 6</p>

                            <p>5. You can live forever on earth.—Ps. 37:29; Matt. 5:5.</p>
                            <p>God’s original purpose was for humans to live forever on earth, and he has not abandoned that plan. The meek, those who humbly submit to Jehovah’s will, will inherit the earth and enjoy everlasting life in peace and happiness, as promised in the Scriptures.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it." - Psalm 37:29</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"Happy are the mild-tempered, since they will inherit the earth." - Matthew 5:5</p>

                            <p>6. A husband should “love his wife as he does himself.”—Eph. 5:33; Col. 3:19.</p>
                            <p>The Bible instructs husbands to show self-sacrificing love, putting their wife’s needs ahead of their own, just as Christ loved the congregation. This love involves tenderness, understanding, and support, ensuring that the wife feels cherished and secure in the marriage.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"Nevertheless, each one of you must love his wife as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband." - Ephesians 5:33</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"You husbands, keep on loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them." - Colossians 3:19</p>

                            <p>7. A wife should deeply respect her husband.—Eph. 5:33; Col. 3:18.</p>
                            <p>Respect involves honoring the husband’s role as head of the family, supporting his decisions, and showing appreciation for his efforts. This creates a harmonious partnership where both husband and wife feel valued and work together to build a loving family.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"Nevertheless, each one of you must love his wife as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband." - Ephesians 5:33</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"You wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as it is becoming in the Lord." - Colossians 3:18</p>

                            <p>8. A husband and a wife should be loyal to each other.—Mal. 2:16; Matt. 19:4-6, 9; Heb. 13:4.</p>
                            <p>God views marriage as a sacred bond, a union that should not be broken by infidelity or abandonment. Loyalty means remaining faithful in thought, word, and action, ensuring that the marriage remains a safe and secure refuge for both partners.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"For I hate divorce,” says Jehovah the God of Israel, “and the one who covers his garment with violence,” says Jehovah of armies. “So guard yourselves respecting your spirit, and do not deal treacherously." - Malachi 2:16</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"In reply he said: 'Have you not read that the one who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh’? So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together, let no man put apart.' ... I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the grounds of sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery." - Matthew 19:4-6, 9</p>

                            <p>9. Children who respect and obey their parents will succeed.—Prov. 1:8, 9; Eph. 6:1-3.</p>
                            <p>Children who listen to their parents’ guidance gain wisdom and avoid many pitfalls in life. Obedience to parents, as long as their instructions align with God’s principles, brings blessings, including a long and fulfilling life, as the Bible promises.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the instruction of your mother. For they are a garland of favor for your head and a fine necklace for your throat." - Proverbs 1:8, 9</p>

                            <p>10. God has a name.—Ps. 83:18; Jer. 10:10.</p>
                            <p>God’s name, Jehovah, appears thousands of times in ancient Bible manuscripts. Using his name shows that we recognize him as a real person, not an abstract force, and it honors him as the Creator who desires a close relationship with us.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth." - Psalm 83:18</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"But Jehovah is truly God. He is the living God and the eternal King. Because of his indignation the earth will quake, and no nations will endure his denunciation." - Jeremiah 10:10</p>

                            <p>The Bible is God’s inspired Word, written by human servants under the direction of his holy spirit. It contains his thoughts, principles, and promises, equipping us to make wise decisions and live in a way that pleases him.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, so that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work." - 2 Timothy 3:16, 17</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"For you know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture springs from any private interpretation. For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit." - 2 Peter 1:20, 21</p>

                            <p>Jehovah does not show favoritism based on race, nationality, or social standing. He looks at a person’s heart, their faith, and their actions, ensuring that all who seek him with sincerity are accepted and blessed by him.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"For Jehovah your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the God great, mighty, and awe-inspiring, who does not show favoritism or take a bribe." - Deuteronomy 10:17</p>

                            <p>Jehovah is described as a refuge and strength, always ready to assist those who call on him. He listens to the prayers of the righteous and fulfills their heartfelt desires, providing comfort and guidance in times of need.</p>

                            <p>Prayer is an expression of trust in Jehovah, a way to pour out our hearts to him. He invites us to cast our anxieties on him, assuring us that he hears and cares for us, strengthening our faith and drawing us closer to him.</p>

                            <p>15. The Bible teaches us how to pray.—Matt. 6:7-13; Luke 11:1-4.</p>
                            <p>Jesus taught his followers to pray with sincerity, focusing on God’s will, our daily needs, forgiveness, and protection from temptation. The model prayer emphasizes keeping God’s name holy and seeking his Kingdom first, showing us the proper priorities in prayer.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"When praying, do not say the same things over and over again as the people of the nations do, for they imagine they will get a hearing for their use of many words. So do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need even before you ask him. You must pray, then, this way: 'Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth. Give us today our bread for this day; and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one.'" - Matthew 6:7-13</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"Now he was in a certain place praying, and when he stopped, one of his disciples said to him: 'Lord, teach us how to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.' So he said to them: 'Whenever you pray, say: ‘Father, let your name be sanctified. Let your Kingdom come. Give us our bread for this day according to our daily need. And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is in debt to us; and do not bring us into temptation.’'" - Luke 11:1-4</p>

                            <p>16. We should pray often.—Matt. 7:7, 8; 1 Thess. 5:17.</p>
                            <p>The Bible encourages us to pray persistently and without ceasing, making prayer a constant part of our lives. This habit helps us maintain a close relationship with Jehovah, relying on him for guidance and strength in all circumstances.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"Keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you; for everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking, it will be opened." - Matthew 7:7, 8</p>

                            <p>17. Jesus was a great teacher whose advice always works.—Matt. 6:14, 15, 34; 7:12.</p>
                            <p>Jesus’ teachings, such as the Golden Rule and advice on forgiveness, are timeless principles that lead to peace and happiness. His counsel to avoid unnecessary anxiety by focusing on today’s needs helps us trust in Jehovah’s care and live with a positive outlook.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; whereas if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." - Matthew 6:14, 15</p>

                            <p>18. Jesus foretold events we see today.—Matt. 24:3, 7, 8, 14; Luke 21:10, 11.</p>
                            <p>Jesus predicted wars, food shortages, earthquakes, and the global preaching of the good news as signs of the last days. These events, along with the spread of the Kingdom message worldwide, confirm that we are living in the time he spoke about, nearing the end of this system.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: 'Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?' ... 'For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another. All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress.' ...

                            <p>Jesus’ role as God’s Son highlights his unique relationship with Jehovah. He was sent to earth to give his life as a ransom, making it possible for humans to be reconciled to God and gain everlasting life through faith in him.</p>

                            <p>God’s Kingdom, with Jesus as its appointed King, is a heavenly government that will rule over the earth. It will bring peace, justice, and righteousness, fulfilling Jehovah’s purpose for humanity as expressed in the model prayer taught by Jesus.</p>

                            <p>Jehovah is a God of justice and love, incapable of causing evil or suffering. The Bible explains that suffering often results from human imperfection, the influence of Satan, or time and unforeseen events, but Jehovah is not to blame for our trials.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness who is never unjust; righteous and upright is he." - Deuteronomy 32:4</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"When under trial, let no one say: 'I am being tried by God.' For with evil things God cannot be tried, nor does he himself try anyone." - James 1:13</p>

                            <p>25. Satan rules this world.—Luke 4:5, 6; 1 John 5:19.</p>
                            <p>Satan has temporary authority over the world, using his influence to promote selfishness, violence, and injustice. This explains why suffering and wickedness are so widespread, as Satan opposes Jehovah’s righteous standards and seeks to mislead humanity.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"So he brought him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time. Then the Devil said to him: 'I will give you all this authority and their glory, because it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.'" - Luke 4:5, 6</p>

                            <p>26. God cares about your suffering.—Ps. 34:17-19; Isa. 41:10, 13.</p>
                            <p>Jehovah is a compassionate God who hears the cries of those who suffer. He promises to be with us, strengthening and supporting us through our trials, and he assures us that he will never abandon those who trust in him.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"They cried out, and Jehovah heard; he rescued them from all their distresses. Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those who are crushed in spirit." - Psalm 34:17-18</p>

                            <p>27. God will soon end suffering.—Isa. 65:17; Rev. 21:3, 4.</p>
                            <p>In the new world, Jehovah will wipe out every tear, and suffering will be a thing of the past. This promise gives hope to those enduring hardships, assuring them that God’s Kingdom will bring an end to all forms of pain and sorrow.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"For look! I am creating new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be called to mind, nor will they come up into the heart." - Isaiah 65:17</p>

                            <p>28. The dead are unconscious; they are not suffering.—Eccl. 9:5; John 11:11-14.</p>
                            <p>The Bible compares death to sleep, a state of complete unconsciousness where the dead cannot think, feel, or act. This understanding brings comfort, as it means our loved ones who have died are not suffering in any way.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all, nor do they have any more reward, because all memory of them is forgotten." - Ecclesiastes 9:5</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"After he said these things, he added: 'Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep, but I am traveling there to awaken him.' ... Then Jesus said to them plainly: 'Lazarus has died.'" - John 11:11, 14</p>

                            <p>29. The dead cannot help us or harm us.—Ps. 146:4; Eccl. 9:6, 10.</p>
                            <p>The dead have no ability to influence the living, as they are unconscious and their emotions and actions have ceased. This truth protects us from false beliefs about spirits or the dead, encouraging us to rely on Jehovah for help and guidance.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"His spirit goes out, he returns to the ground; on that very day his thoughts perish." - Psalm 146:4</p>

                            <p>Jehovah has the power to bring the dead back to life, and he longs to do so. The resurrection will reunite families, giving people the opportunity to live forever on a paradise earth, free from the pain of death.</p>
                            <p class="scripture">"O that in the Grave you would conceal me, that you would hide me until your anger passes by, that you would set a time limit for me and remember me!

                            <p>Many religions fail to teach the truth about Jehovah and his purposes, often promoting false doctrines or practices that dishonor him. The Bible urges us to worship God in a way that aligns with his standards, as only true worship leads to life.</p>
