To create a JavaScript array containing the names and descriptions of biblical characters from both provided HTML snippets (the first file covering Aaron to Meshach, and the second file covering Micah to Zophar), I’ll extract each character’s name (from the
element) and their description (from the first
element within
). The array will be an array of objects, where each object has a name and description property. I’ll combine the characters from both files into a single array, ensuring no duplicates and maintaining alphabetical order.

Assumptions and Approach
	•	The first HTML snippet (Aaron to Meshach) and the second snippet (Micah to Zophar) are part of the same webpage, so I’ll merge their character data.
	•	Each character’s description is the first  element inside  , excluding scripture references. 
	•	The array will be sorted alphabetically by name for consistency.
	•	If any characters appear in both files (none do in this case, as the lists are sequential), I’ll ensure no duplicates by checking names.
	•	I’ll omit any incomplete or malformed entries, but both snippets appear well-formed.
