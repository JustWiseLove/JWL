                <div class="reference">Luke 1:5-25</div>
                <div class="scripture-text">In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah of the division of Abijah, and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. They were both righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in accord with all the commandments and legal requirements of Jehovah. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well along in years. Now as Zechariah was serving as priest before God when his division was assigned to duties, according to the custom of the priesthood it became his turn to offer incense when he entered into the sanctuary of Jehovah. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of offering incense. An angel of Jehovah appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. But Zechariah became troubled at the sight, and he was overcome with fear. However, the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your supplication has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John. You will have joy and exultation, and many will rejoice over his birth, for he will be great in the sight of Jehovah. But he must not drink wine or any fermented drink, and he will be filled with holy spirit even from before his birth. And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to Jehovah their God. Also, he will go before him with the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to children and the disobedient ones to the practical wisdom of righteous ones, to get ready for Jehovah a prepared people.” Zechariah said to the angel: “How can I be sure of this? For I am old, and my wife is well along in years.” In reply the angel said to him: “I am Gabriel, who stands near before God, and I was sent to speak to you and to declare this good news to you. But look! you will be silent and unable to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their appointed time.” Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah, wondering why he delayed in the sanctuary. When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a supernatural sight in the sanctuary. He kept making signs to them but remained speechless. So when the days of his holy service were completed, he went off to his home. Some days later Elizabeth his wife became pregnant, and she kept herself secluded for five months, saying: “This is the way Jehovah has dealt with me in these days; he has turned his attention to me to take away my reproach among men.”</div>

                <div class="reference">Luke 1:26-38</div>
                <div class="scripture-text">In her sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin promised in marriage to a man named Joseph of David’s house; and the virgin’s name was Mary. And when he came to her, he said: “Greetings, you highly favored one, Jehovah is with you.” But she was deeply disturbed at his words and tried to understand what kind of greeting this might be. So the angel said to her: “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And look! you will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus. This one will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule as King over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end to his Kingdom.” But Mary said to the angel: “How is this to be, since I am not having sexual relations with a man?” In answer the angel said to her: “Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. For that reason also what is born will be called holy, God’s Son. And look! Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren, for no declaration will be impossible for God.” Then Mary said: “Look! Jehovah’s slave girl! May it take place with me according to your declaration.” At that the angel departed from her.</div>

                <div class="reference">Luke 1:39-45</div>
                <div class="scripture-text">So Mary got up and traveled with haste to the hill country, to a city of Judah, and she entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the infant in her womb leaped, and Elizabeth was filled with holy spirit, and she called out with a loud cry: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! So how is it that this privilege is mine, to have the mother of my Lord come to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. Happy too is she who believed, for there will be a complete fulfillment of those things spoken to her from Jehovah.”</div>

                <div class="reference">Luke 1:46-56</div>
                <div class="scripture-text">And Mary said: “My soul magnifies Jehovah, and my spirit cannot help but rejoice in God my Savior, because he has looked upon the low position of his slave girl. For look! from now on all generations will pronounce me happy, because the powerful One has done great things for me, and holy is his name, and his mercy is for generation after generation of those who fear him. He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are haughty in the thoughts of their hearts. He has brought down powerful ones from thrones and has exalted lowly ones; he has fully satisfied the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty-handed. He has come to the aid of Israel his servant, remembering his mercy, just as he spoke to our forefathers, to Abraham and to his offspring, forever.” Mary stayed with her about three months and then returned to her own home.</div>

                <div class="reference">Luke 1:57-66</div>
                <div class="scripture-text">The time now came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she had a son. Then her neighbors and relatives heard that Jehovah had greatly favored her, and they rejoiced with her. And on the eighth day, they came to circumcise the young child, and they were going to name him after his father, Zechariah. But his mother objected, saying: “No! but he will be called John.” At this they said to her: “None of your relatives is called by this name.” Then they asked his father by signs what he wanted him to be called. So he asked for a tablet and wrote: “John is his name.” At this they were all amazed. Instantly his mouth was opened and his tongue was freed and he began to speak, blessing God. And fear fell upon all their neighbors, and in the entire hilly country of Judea, all these things began to be talked about. And all who heard took these things to heart, saying: “What then will this child be?” For the hand of Jehovah was indeed with him.</div>

                <div class="reference">Luke 1:67-80</div>
                <div class="scripture-text">And Zechariah his father was filled with holy spirit and prophesied, saying: “Let Jehovah be praised, the God of Israel, because he has turned his attention to his people and has brought them deliverance. And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant, just as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old, salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those hating us, to show mercy in connection with our forefathers and to call to mind his holy covenant, the oath that he swore to Abraham our father, to grant us, after we have been rescued from the hand of enemies, the privilege of fearlessly rendering sacred service to him with loyalty and righteousness before him all our days. And you, young child, will be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go ahead of Jehovah to prepare his ways, to give knowledge of salvation to his people by forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender compassion of our God. With this compassion a daybreak will visit us from on high, to give light to those sitting in darkness and death’s shadow and to guide our feet in the way of peace.” And the young child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day he showed himself openly to Israel.</div>

                <div class="reference">Matthew 1:18-25</div>
                <div class="scripture-text">But this is how the birth of Jesus Christ took place. During the time his mother Mary was promised in marriage to Joseph, she was found to be pregnant by holy spirit before they were united. However, Joseph her husband, because he was righteous and did not want to make her a public spectacle, intended to divorce her secretly. But after he had thought these things over, look! Jehovah’s angel appeared to him in a dream, saying: “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife home, for what has been conceived in her is by holy spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” All this actually came about to fulfill what was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet, saying: “Look! The virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel,” which means, when translated, “With Us Is God.” Then Joseph woke up from his sleep and did as the angel of Jehovah had directed him, and he took his wife home. But he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son, and he named him Jesus.</div>

                <div class="scripture-text">Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for all the inhabited earth to be registered. (This first registration took place when Quirinius was governor of Syria.) And all the people went to be registered, each to his own city. Of course, Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, to get registered with Mary, who had been given him in marriage as promised and who was soon to give birth. While they were there, the time came for her to give birth. So she gave birth to her son, the firstborn, and she wrapped him in cloth bands and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the lodging place.</div>

                <div class="scripture-text">There were also in the same region shepherds living out of doors and keeping watch in the night over their flocks. Suddenly Jehovah’s angel stood before them, and Jehovah’s glory gleamed around them, and they became very fearful. But the angel said to them: “Do not be afraid, for look! I am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have. For today there was born to you in David’s city a savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this is a sign for you: You will find an infant wrapped in cloth bands and lying in a manger.” Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying: “Glory in the heights above to God, and on earth peace among men of goodwill.”</div>

                <div class="scripture-text">So when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another: “Let us by all means go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which Jehovah has made known to us.” So they went in a hurry and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known the message that they had been told concerning this young child. And all who heard were astonished at what the shepherds told them, but Mary began to preserve all these sayings, drawing conclusions in her heart. Then the shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them.</div>

Also, when the days for their purification according to the Law of Moses came to an end, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to Jehovah, as it is written in Jehovah’s Law: “Every male opening the womb will be called holy to Jehovah,” and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of Jehovah: “A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”</div>

Furthermore, it had been divinely revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Christ of Jehovah. Under the power of the spirit, he came into the temple; and when the parents brought the young child Jesus in to do for him according to the customary practice of the Law, he took him into his arms and blessed God and said: “Now, Sovereign Lord, you are letting your slave go in peace according to your declaration, because my eyes have seen your means of salvation that you have prepared in the sight of all the peoples, a light for removing the veil from the nations and a glory of your people Israel.” And the child’s father and mother continued wondering at the things being spoken about him. Also, Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother: “This child is appointed for the falling and the rising again of many in Israel and for a sign to be spoken against—yes, a long sword will be run through you yourself—so that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.”</div>

(This woman was well along in years and had lived with a husband for seven years after her virginity, and she was a widow now 84 years old, who was never missing from the temple, rendering sacred service night and day with fastings and supplications.) And in that very hour she came forward and began giving thanks to God and speaking about the child to all those waiting for Jerusalem’s deliverance.</div>

                <div class="scripture-text">After Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, look! astrologers from the East came to Jerusalem, saying: “Where is the one born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when we were in the East, and we have come to do obeisance to him.” At hearing this, King Herod was agitated, and all Jerusalem with him. On gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They said to him: “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what has been written by the prophet: ‘And you, O Bethlehem of the land of Judah, are by no means the most insignificant city among the governors of Judah, for out of you will come a governing one, who will shepherd my people Israel.’” Then Herod secretly summoned the astrologers and carefully ascertained from them the time of the star’s appearing. When sending them to Bethlehem, he said: “Go make a careful search for the young child, and when you have found him, report back to me, so that I too may go and do obeisance to him.” After they had heard the king, they went their way, and look! the star they had seen when they were in the East went ahead of them until it came to a stop above where the young child was. On seeing the star, they rejoiced with great joy. And when they went into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and falling down, they did obeisance to him. They also opened their treasures and presented him with gifts—gold and frankincense and myrrh. However, because they were given divine warning in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their country by another way.</div>

But on hearing that Archelaus was ruling Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Moreover, being given divine warning in a dream, he withdrew to the territory of Galilee, and he went and took up residence in a city called Nazareth so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled: “He will be called a Nazarene.”<br>

And when he was 12 years old, they went up according to the custom of the festival. When the days of the festival were over and they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and his parents did not notice it. Assuming that he was in the group traveling together, they went a day’s journey and then began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances. But not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem, making a diligent search for him. Well, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them and asking them questions. All those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers. Now when they saw him, they were astounded, and his mother said to him: “Child, why did you treat us this way?

                    In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying: “Repent, for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” This, in fact, is the one spoken of through Isaiah the prophet in these words: “A voice of one calling out in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah! Make his roads straight!’” Now John was clothed with camel’s hair and had a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea and all the country around the Jordan were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, openly confessing their sins. When he caught sight of many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism, he said to them: “You offspring of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Therefore, produce fruit that befits repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones. The ax is already lying at the root of the trees. Every tree, then, that does not produce fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire. I, for my part, baptize you with water because of your repentance, but the one coming after me is stronger than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to take off. That one will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire. His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clean out his threshing floor completely and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.”<br>
                    <strong>Luke 3:3-18</strong><br>
                    So he went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of one crying out in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah! Make his roads straight. Every valley must be filled up, and every mountain and hill leveled; the crooked ways must become straight, and the rough ways smooth, and all flesh will see the salvation of God.’” Therefore, he said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him: “You offspring of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Therefore, produce fruits that befit repentance. And do not start saying within yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones. Indeed, the ax is already lying at the root of the trees. Every tree, therefore, not producing fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire.” So the crowds were asking him: “What, then, should we do?” In reply he said to them: “Let the man who has two garments share with the man who has none, and let the one who has food do the same.” Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they said to him: “Teacher, what should we do?” He said to them: “Do not demand anything more than the tax rate.” Also, soldiers on active duty were asking him: “What should we do?” And he said to them: “Do not harass anybody or accuse anybody falsely, but be satisfied with your provisions.” Now the people were in expectation, and all of them were reasoning in their hearts about John, wondering whether he might perhaps be the Christ. John gave the answer, saying to all: “I, for my part, baptize you with water, but the one stronger than I am is coming, the lace of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire. His winnowing shovel is in his hand to clean out his threshing floor completely and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.” So with many other exhortations he continued to declare the good news to the people.<br>
                    <strong>Mark 1:1-8</strong><br>
                    The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God: As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Look! I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way, a voice of one crying out in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah! Make his roads straight!’” John the Baptist was in the wilderness, preaching baptism in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins. And all the territory of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, openly confessing their sins. Now John wore clothing of camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. And he was preaching: “Someone stronger than I am is coming after me, the lace of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with holy spirit.”

But the latter tried to prevent him, saying: “I am the one who needs to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?” In reply Jesus said to him: “Let it be this time, for in this way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.” Then he quit preventing him. After being baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water; and look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw God’s spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him. Look! Also, there was a voice from the heavens that said: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.”<br>

What do you say about yourself?” He said: “I am a voice of someone crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make the way of Jehovah straight,’ just as Isaiah the prophet said.” Now those sent were from the Pharisees. So they questioned him and said to him: “Why, then, do you baptize if you are neither the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?” John answered them: “I baptize in water.

First this man found his own brother, Simon, and said to him: “We have found the Messiah” (which means, when translated, Christ). He led him to Jesus.

Philip found Nathanael and said to him: “We have found the one of whom Moses, in the Law, and the Prophets wrote: Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.” But Nathanael said to him: “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him: “Come and see.” When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he said about him: “See, truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.” Nathanael said to him: “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him: “Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” Nathanael responded: “Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel.” Jesus answered him: “Do you believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.” Then he said to him: “Most truly I say to you men, you will see heaven opened up and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.”</div>

Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the marriage feast. When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him: “They have no wine.” But Jesus said to her: “Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.” His mother said to those serving: “Do whatever he tells you.” Now there were six stone water jars sitting there, as required by the purification rules of the Jews, each able to hold two or three liquid measures. Jesus said to them: “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them to the brim. Then he said to them: “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.” So they took it. When the master of the feast tasted the water that had now been turned into wine, not knowing where it came from (although the servants who had drawn out the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him: “Everyone else puts out the fine wine first, and when people are intoxicated, the inferior. You have saved the fine wine until now.” Jesus did this in Cana of Galilee as the beginning of his signs, and he made his glory manifest, and his disciples put their faith in him. After this he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples went down to Capernaum, but they did not stay there many days.</div>

So after making a whip of ropes, he drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.

When, though, he was raised up from the dead, his disciples recalled that he used to say this, and they believed the scripture and what Jesus had spoken.</div>

This one came to him in the night and said to him: “Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, for no one can perform these signs that you perform unless God is with him.” In response Jesus said to him: “Most truly I say to you, unless anyone is born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.” Nicodemus said to him: “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter into the womb of his mother a second time and be born, can he?” Jesus answered: “Most truly I say to you, unless anyone is born from water and spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. What has been born from the flesh is flesh, and what has been born from the spirit is spirit. Do not be amazed because I told you: You people must be born again. The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So it is with everyone who has been born from the spirit.” In answer Nicodemus said to him: “How can these things take place?” Jesus replied: “Are you a teacher of Israel and yet do not understand these things? Most truly I say to you, what we know we speak, and what we have seen we bear witness to, but you people do not accept the witness we give. If I have told you earthly things and you still do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? Moreover, no man has ascended into heaven but the one who descended from heaven, the Son of man.”</div>

Whoever does not exercise faith has been judged already, because he has not exercised faith in the name of the only-begotten Son of God. Now this is the basis for judgment: that the light has come into the world, but men have loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were wicked. For whoever practices vile things hates the light and does not come to the light, so that his works may not be reproved. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that his works may be made evident as having been done in harmony with God.</div>

Then a dispute arose between John’s disciples and a Jew concerning purification. So they came to John and said to him: “Rabbi, the man who was with you across the Jordan, about whom you bore witness, look! this one is baptizing, and all are going to him.” In reply John said: “A man cannot receive a single thing unless it has been given him from heaven. You yourselves bear witness that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of that one.’ The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, when he stands and hears him, has a great deal of joy because of the voice of the bridegroom. So my joy has been made complete.

In answer Jesus said to her: “If you had known of the free gift of God and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” She said to him: “Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. From what source, then, do you have this living water? You are not greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well and who drank from it himself, along with his sons and his cattle, are you?” In answer Jesus said to her: “Everyone drinking from this water will get thirsty again. Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.” The woman said to him: “Sir, give me this water, so that I may neither thirst nor keep coming over to this place to draw water.”</div>

This you have said truthfully.” The woman said to him: “Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain, but you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where people must worship.” Jesus said to her: “Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, because salvation originates with the Jews. Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for indeed, the Father is looking for ones like these to worship him.

But while he was still on his way down, his slaves met him to say that his boy was alive. So he asked them at what hour he got better. They said to him: “Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him.” The father then knew that it was at the very hour that Jesus had said to him: “Your son lives.” So he and his whole household believed.

He sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away free, to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year.” With that he rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were intently fixed on him. Then he started to say to them: “Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.” And they all began to give favorable witness about him and to be amazed at the gracious words coming out of his mouth, and they were saying: “This is a son of Joseph, is it not?” But he said to them: “No doubt you will apply this saying to me, ‘Physician, cure yourself. The things we heard you did in Capernaum, do also here in your home territory.’” Then he said: “Truly I tell you that no prophet is accepted in his home territory. For example, I tell you in truth: There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months, so that a great famine came on all the land, yet Elijah was sent to none of those women, but only to a widow in Zarephath in the land of Sidon. Also, there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, only Naaman the Syrian.” Now all those hearing these things in the synagogue became filled with anger, and they rose up and rushed him outside the city, and they led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, in order to throw him down headlong.

                    <strong>Luke 5:1-11</strong><br>
                    On one occasion when the crowd was pressing in on him and listening to the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret. And he saw two boats docked at the shore of the lake, but the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets. Going aboard one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, he asked him to pull away a bit from land. Then he sat down, and he began teaching the crowds from the boat. When he ceased speaking, he said to Simon: “Pull out to where it is deep, and let down your nets for a catch.” But in reply Simon said: “Instructor, we toiled all night and caught nothing, but at your word I will lower the nets.” Well, when they did this, they caught a great number of fish, and their nets began to rip. So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats, so that they were about to sink. Seeing this, Simon Peter fell at the knees of Jesus, saying: “Depart from me, Lord, because I am a sinful man.” For both he and all those with him were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, and so were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s partners. But Jesus said to Simon: “Stop being afraid. From now on you will be catching men alive.” So they brought the boats back to land and abandoned everything and followed him.<br>
                    <strong>Matthew 4:18-22</strong><br>
                    Walking alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. And he said to them: “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.” At once they abandoned their nets and followed him. Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them. At once they left the boat and their father and followed him.<br>

                    While passing along by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting their nets into the sea, for they were fishermen. So Jesus said to them: “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.” And at once they abandoned their nets and followed him. Going a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. At once he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went off after him.
