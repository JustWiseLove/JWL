                        <p>The Bible stands as Jehovah’s unshakable truth—written by honest men, proven by history and science, and enduring all attacks. Why trust it?</p>
                        <p><strong>Men Moved by God:</strong> Over 40 writers across 1,600 years—fishermen, kings, prophets—wrote as one under Jehovah’s spirit (2 Peter 1:21), baring their flaws (Exodus 4:10, Psalm 51).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial…” <cite>—2 Timothy 3:16</cite></p>
                        <p><strong>Science Confirms It:</strong> The earth hangs “upon nothing” (Job 26:7), is a “circle” (Isaiah 40:22), and blood is life (Leviticus 17:11)—facts ahead of human discovery.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Your word is truth.” <cite>—John 17:17</cite></p>
                        <p><strong>History Proves It:</strong> Sennacherib’s Prism (2 Kings 18-19), the Pilate Stone (John 19:13), and the Dead Sea Scrolls (Isaiah 40:8) affirm its accuracy.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The word of our God endures forever.” <cite>—Isaiah 40:8</cite></p>
                        <p><strong>The Only Lasting Path:</strong> Wealth and fame fail (Ecclesiastes 5:10), but knowing Jehovah brings life (John 17:3) through study and prayer.</p>

                        <p><strong>Unshaken by Time:</strong> Burned, banned, yet thriving in 3,000+ languages, its purity holds (Psalm 12:6; Isaiah 55:11).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The word of Jehovah endures forever.” <cite>—1 Peter 1:25</cite></p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The Bible stands as Jehovah’s inspired Word, a divine gift distinct from human philosophies or religious texts rooted in false worship, such as pagan myths or materialistic ideologies. It reveals God’s will and purpose for humanity, offering guidance for life’s challenges, as affirmed by 2 Timothy 3:16: 'All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.' Historically, its preservation through centuries—despite attempts to suppress it—demonstrates divine protection. Scientifically, its references, like the earth’s suspension (Job 26:7), align with later discoveries, proving its reliability. Studying it equips us to reject false teachings, like idol worship or soul immortality, and fosters a relationship with Jehovah based on truth.</p>

                        <p>The Bible was penned by over 40 human writers—kings, prophets, fishermen—spanning 1,600 years, yet its unity stems from Jehovah’s holy spirit, as 2 Peter 1:21 states: 'Men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.' Unlike pagan texts filled with contradictory myths, its consistent message across centuries proves divine authorship. Historically, its composition began with Moses around 1513 B.C.E. and concluded with John’s writings around 98 C.E., surviving persecution and translation into thousands of languages. Science supports its accuracy, such as the hydrologic cycle in Job 36:27-28, predating modern understanding. This refutes false worship’s claim of human origin, affirming Jehovah as its true Author.</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The Bible’s scientific accuracy shines through statements made long before human discovery, such as Job 26:7: 'He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.' This aligns with the earth’s suspension in space, a fact unknown in ancient times. Unlike false worship’s flat-earth myths or Babylonian cosmologies, Isaiah 40:22 describes Jehovah as 'the One who dwells above the circle of the earth,' hinting at its spherical shape. Historically, its sanitation laws (Leviticus 11-15) predate germ theory, saving lives. These facts dismantle claims of inaccuracy, proving the Bible’s divine origin and its superiority over pagan falsehoods.</p>

                        <p>Jehovah, God’s personal name, appears over 7,000 times in the original texts, as Psalm 83:18 declares: 'You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.' False worship obscures this name with titles like 'Lord,' a practice rooted in superstition and tradition, not Scripture. Historically, the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) was revered by Israel, yet removed by later scribes influenced by pagan customs. Science offers no contradiction, but the Bible’s consistent use across millennia confirms its authenticity. Knowing Jehovah’s name sets true worship apart from the nameless deities of false religion.</p>

                        <p>Jesus Christ is Jehovah’s firstborn Son, not God Almighty, as Colossians 1:15 states: 'He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.' False worship, like the Trinity doctrine from pagan triads, equates him with Jehovah, but Scripture distinguishes them. Historically, Jesus’ role as Messiah was foretold (Isaiah 9:6) and fulfilled in 29 C.E., initiating Christianity. Science aligns with his miracles, like healing, as acts of divine power, not myth. He’s the ransom and future King, refuting false claims of co-equality and affirming Jehovah’s supremacy in true worship.</p>

False worship’s Trinity portrays it as a deity, borrowing from pagan trios like Egypt’s Osiris-Isis-Horus, but the Bible shows it as God’s power at work. Historically, it inspired prophets and empowered Jesus’ miracles (Luke 4:1). Scientifically, its effects—like creation’s order—suggest a purposeful force, not a random entity. Understanding this counters false teachings and honors Jehovah’s true nature.</p>

False worship teaches a temporary earth or soul ascension, echoing pagan afterlife myths, but the Bible promises an eternal paradise. Historically, Genesis records this purpose from creation’s start.

False worship minimizes sin with rituals or excuses, like pagan sacrifices to appease gods, but the Bible calls it rebellion against Jehovah. Historically, sin entered through Adam’s disobedience in Eden (Genesis 3). Science shows human imperfection—disease and death—as sin’s effects, not evolution’s design. Recognizing sin’s gravity drives us to seek Jehovah’s forgiveness, not human solutions.</p>

False worship’s soul immortality, rooted in Babylonian and Greek myths, contradicts this, but the Bible promises death’s end (1 Corinthians 15:26). Historically, Adam’s sin in 4026 B.C.E. (per Bible chronology) introduced mortality. Science confirms death as universal, unlike false claims of eternal consciousness. Jehovah’s purpose to eliminate death offers hope beyond pagan lies.</p>

False worship sprinkles babies, a tradition from pagan rites, but the Bible requires conscious faith and full immersion (Matthew 3:16).

                        <p>The tree of knowledge symbolized Jehovah’s right to set moral boundaries, as Genesis 2:17 warns: 'You must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.' False worship twists it into mere myth, like Babylonian epics, but the Bible ties it to obedience (Genesis 3:3). Historically, Adam’s disobedience brought sin. Science can’t explain morality’s origin, but Jehovah’s standard remains clear.</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Spiritism defies Jehovah, as Deuteronomy 18:11 forbids: 'There should not be found in you anyone who... consults a spirit medium.' False worship embraces it, like Babylonian necromancy, but the Bible warns of demonic deception (1 Timothy 4:1). Historically, Saul’s fall via a medium proved its danger. Science debunks spirit claims, aligning with Jehovah’s prohibition.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Demonic deception.</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The conclusion is to fear Jehovah and keep His commands, as Ecclesiastes 12:13 states: 'Fear the true God and keep his commandments.' False worship chases vanity, like pagan rituals, but the Bible offers purpose through obedience (John 17:3). Historically, faithful ones like Daniel thrived by this. Science confirms life’s meaninglessness without God, proving Jehovah’s way leads to life.</p>
