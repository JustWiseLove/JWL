                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(1st–2nd Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>After the apostles’ death, false worship infiltrated Christianity, as “savage wolves” emerged (Acts 20:29). Satan, “the father of the lie” (John 8:44), blended paganism with truth, obscuring Jehovah’s worship.</p>
                        <p><strong>Gnosticism:</strong> Gnostics denied Jehovah’s sovereignty, promoting Babylonian star worship, contradicting “Jehovah is the true God” (Jeremiah 10:10). Their teachings led many astray.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ignatius of Antioch (d. c. 110 CE):</strong> Ignatius introduced a clergy-laity divide, calling bishops superior, defying “You are all brothers” (Matthew 23:8). His letters spread unscriptural hierarchies, echoing Babylonian priestly systems.</p>
                        <p><strong>Polycarp’s Resistance:</strong> A disciple of John, Polycarp rejected pagan festivals like Saturnalia, declaring, “I am a Christian,” before his 155 CE martyrdom. His stand upheld truth, as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <h2>Faithful Stand</h2>
                        <p>Polycarp’s courage preserved true worship’s foundation, resisting Satan’s schemes, as “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” — Revelation 2:10</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Nicene Corruption: Constantine’s Trinity</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(4th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Council of Nicaea (325 CE) marked apostasy’s peak, as “Babylon the Great” corrupted worship (Revelation 17:5). Constantine merged paganism with Christianity, obscuring Jehovah’s name.</p>
                        <p><strong>Constantine (272–337 CE):</strong> Convening Nicaea, Constantine adopted the Trinity, a Babylonian concept, using “homoousios” to equate Jesus with God, contradicting “I am Jehovah, there is no other” (Isaiah 45:5). His Edict of Milan (313 CE) promoted pagan festivals like Christmas, rooted in Mithra’s birthday (Jeremiah 10:2).</p>
                        <p><strong>Arius (256–336 CE):</strong> Arius upheld Jesus as “the firstborn of creation” (Colossians 1:15), rejecting the Trinity. Exiled by Nicaea’s bishops, his stand risked death, as “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p>
                        <h2>Resisting Apostasy</h2>
                        <p>Arius’s courage preserved truth’s spark, countering Constantine’s decrees, as “I am Jehovah, that is my name” (Isaiah 42:8).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This is my name forever.” — Exodus 3:15</p>

                        <h2>(4th–5th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>As Catholic apostasy grew, blending paganism with Christianity, faithful scribe Jerome ensured the Bible’s survival, countering “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5). His work preserved Jehovah’s truth against Satan’s lies, as “the word of God is not bound” (2 Timothy 2:9).</p>
                        <p><strong>Jerome (347–420 CE):</strong> Commissioned by Pope Damasus, Jerome translated the Latin Vulgate (405 CE), using Hebrew and Greek texts containing “YHWH.” Unlike Nicaea’s Trinitarian errors, his scholarship retained scriptural integrity, consulting original manuscripts to preserve Jehovah’s name and laws. Preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, his translation reached scholars, enabling future restorers, as “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8).</p>
                        <h2>Enduring Truth</h2>
                        <p>Jerome’s Vulgate, though used by a corrupt church, preserved Jehovah’s Word, complementing later efforts to restore pure worship.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“My words will not pass away.” — Matthew 24:35</p>

                        <h2>(12th–13th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Waldensians battled Catholic suppression to preserve Jehovah’s Word, as “the dragon was enraged” (Revelation 12:17).</p>
                        <p><strong>Waldensians:</strong> Led by Peter Waldo, the Waldensians translated vernacular Bibles, defying Catholic bans on scripture access. Branded heretics, they hid manuscripts in the Alps, sharing truth with the poor. Their efforts countered papal indulgences and pagan rituals, fulfilling “You must worship with spirit and truth” (John 4:24).</p>
                        <h2>Preserving Truth</h2>
                        <p>The Waldensians’ courage ensured scripture’s survival, laying groundwork for Reformation restorers, as “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8).</p>

                        <h2>(14th–16th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>Reformation translators risked death to restore Jehovah’s Word, breaking Catholic chains, as “those in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another” (Malachi 3:16).</p>
                        <p><strong>John Wycliffe (1328–1384):</strong> Wycliffe’s 1382 English Bible from the Vulgate defied Catholic bans, spreading truth. Declared a heretic, his bones were burned posthumously, but his work inspired reform, as “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p><strong>Jan Hus (1369–1415):</strong> Hus rejected indulgences, preaching Bible truth. Burned at the stake in 1415, his writings influenced Luther, fulfilling “The truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p>
                        <p><strong>William Tyndale (1494–1536):</strong> Tyndale’s 1530 Pentateuch used “Jehovah” (Exodus 6:3), defying bans. Strangled and burned in 1536, his translations shaped the King James Version, as “declare his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24).</p>
                        <h2>Sacrifices for Truth</h2>
                        <p>These martyrs’ efforts countered apostasy, restoring access to Jehovah’s Word.</p>

                        <p>Before the Bible Students, individuals rejected false doctrines, laying the groundwork for pure worship, as “Jehovah searches for those loyal to him” (2 Chronicles 16:9).</p>
                        <p><strong>Henry Ainsworth (1571–1622):</strong> Ainsworth used “Jehovah” in his 1612 Psalms annotations (Psalm 83:18). Exiled, his work countered Trinitarian errors, as “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1).</p>
                        <p><strong>Henry Grew (1781–1862):</strong> Grew rejected Trinity and hellfire, teaching Jehovah’s name. His pamphlets influenced Russell, fulfilling “The dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5).</p>
                        <p><strong>George Storrs (1796–1879):</strong> Storrs taught earthly resurrection in *Six Sermons*, rejecting immortal soul doctrines, as “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11).</p>

                        <p>Charles Taze Russell spearheaded the restoration of pure worship, rejecting false religion, as “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p><strong>Charles Taze Russell (1852–1916):</strong> Influenced by Grew and Storrs, Russell rejected Trinity, hellfire, and immortal soul doctrines. In 1870, he formed a Pittsburgh Bible study, launching *Zion’s Watch Tower* (1879). Founding the Watch Tower Society (1884), he calculated 1914 as Christ’s enthronement (Daniel 4:25), confirmed by World War I (Matthew 24:7). Persecuted, he restored truth, as “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10).</p>
                        <h2>Restoring Truth</h2>

                        <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses fully restored pure worship, preaching globally, as “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p><strong>Joseph Franklin Rutherford (1869–1942):</strong> Succeeding Russell in 1917, Rutherford was jailed in 1918 for publishing truth. His 43 Supreme Court wins secured preaching rights. Naming the group Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1931 (Isaiah 43:10), he used radio broadcasts, as “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1).</p>
                        <p><strong>Nathan H. Knorr (1905–1977):</strong> From 1942, Knorr oversaw the New World Translation (1950–1961), countering apostate “Lord” substitutions. Founding Gilead School (1943), he trained missionaries for 240 lands, as “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p><strong>Global Mission:</strong> With 8.7 million Witnesses and 1.4 billion preaching hours, they uphold truth despite bans, like Russia’s 2017 ban, as “Jehovah loves those who love him” (Psalm 31:23).</p>
