                <div class="answer">
                    Jehovah created marriage to bring joy, as He is the happy God and wants us to enjoy life through a close bond of love and respect. (Prov. 5:18)

                <div class="answer">

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Christian husbands must guard against adopting improper views of women, as thoughts lead to actions, and worldly thinking can influence them to abuse their wives. (Rom. 12:2)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">

                    5. According to 1 Peter 3:7, how should a husband treat his wife?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    A husband should honor his wife, treating her with kindness and love, as honoring her respects Jehovah’s command. (1 Pet. 3:7)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    1 Peter 3:7: “You husbands, in the same way, continue dwelling with them according to knowledge. Assign them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since they are also heirs with you of the undeserved favor of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.”

                    6. How does Jehovah feel about men who physically abuse their wife?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Jehovah hates violence and condemns husbands who abuse their wives, as it affects their relationship with Him, possibly hindering their prayers. (Col. 3:19)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Colossians 3:19: “You husbands, keep on loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them.”

                    7. According to Ephesians 4:31, 32, what type of speech must husbands avoid?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Husbands must avoid angry, hurtful speech like screaming and abusive words, as Jehovah hates such speech and it damages their marriage and relationship with Him. (Eph. 4:31)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Ephesians 4:31: “Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from you along with all badness.”

                    8. How does Jehovah feel about pornography, and why?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Jehovah hates pornography because it damages a husband’s relationship with Him and degrades his wife, as Jesus said a man who looks lustfully commits adultery in his heart. (Matt. 5:28)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Matthew 5:28: “But I say to you that everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”

                <div class="question">
                    9. Why does Jehovah hate it when a husband is sexually demeaning toward his wife?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Jehovah hates sexually demeaning behavior because it’s cold and thoughtless, and He expects husbands to love, cherish, and respect their wife’s feelings. (Eph. 5:28)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Ephesians 5:28: “In this way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself.”

                    10. How can husbands benefit from Jesus’ example?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Husbands can overcome abusive behavior by imitating Jesus, who treated his disciples with kindness and dignity, serving as a model for loving their wives. (Eph. 5:25)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Ephesians 5:25: “Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it.”

                <div class="question">
                    11. How did Jesus treat his apostles?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Jesus treated his apostles kindly, never harshly, humbly serving them and showing mildness and restraint, even as their Master. (Matt. 11:29)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Matthew 11:29: “Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for yourselves.”

                    12. How did Jesus speak to others?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Jesus spoke to comfort and refresh others, never harshly, even remaining silent when provoked rather than insulting in return. (1 Pet. 2:23)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    1 Peter 2:23: “When he was being insulted, he did not insult in return; when he was suffering, he did not threaten, but he entrusted himself to the One who judges righteously.”

                <div class="answer">
                    A husband can “stick to his wife” by being loyal, as if glued to her, rejecting pornography and not looking lustfully at other women. (Matt. 19:5; Job 31:1)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    An abusive husband should: recognize his problem, stop the abuse, apologize to his wife and Jehovah, seek forgiveness, pray for help, hate violence, seek elders’ help, and plan to avoid such behavior. (Prov. 28:13; Jas. 5:14)

                <div class="answer">

                <div class="answer">
                    Many today focus on themselves, being self-absorbed, such as drawing attention to their accomplishments on social media instead of giving glory to Jehovah.

                    2. How did Jehovah reveal his glory at Mount Sinai?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Jehovah revealed his glory at Mount Sinai with a powerful display: a dark cloud, earthquake, lightning, thunder, and a loud horn, impressing the Israelites. (Ex. 19:16-18)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Exodus 19:16-18: “On the third day when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a heavy cloud on the mountain, and a very loud sound of a horn, so that all the people in the camp trembled. Moses now brought the people out of the camp to meet the true God, and they took their place at the base of the mountain. Mount Sinai was smoking all over, because Jehovah had come down on it in fire; and its smoke was rising like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain was trembling greatly.”

                    3. What does it mean to give Jehovah glory?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    To give Jehovah glory means telling others about His power and qualities and giving Him credit for our accomplishments, as King David did by praising Jehovah’s greatness. (1 Chron. 29:11)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    1 Chronicles 29:11: “Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in the heavens and on the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Jehovah, the one exalting yourself as head over all.”

                    4. How did Jesus give glory to Jehovah?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Jesus gave glory to Jehovah by acknowledging Him as the Source of his miracles and by compassionately healing others, like a woman bent double for 18 years, who then glorified God. (Luke 13:12-13)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Luke 13:12-13: “When Jesus saw her, he called her to him and said: ‘Woman, you are released from your weakness.’ And he laid his hands on her, and instantly she straightened up and began glorifying God.”

                    5. What reasons do we have to respect Jehovah?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    We respect Jehovah because He is almighty, wise, the Source of life, loyal, successful, and keeps His promises, as Jeremiah said, there is no one like Him. (Jer. 10:6)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Jeremiah 10:6: “There is none like you, O Jehovah. You are great, and your name is great in mightiness.”

                    6. Why do we love Jehovah?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    We love Jehovah for His mercy, compassion, empathy, approachability, and humility, as He feels our hurt, draws us close, and lifts the lowly. (Ps. 103:13)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Psalm 103:13: “As a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those who fear him.”

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    We have the opportunity to set the record straight about Jehovah, countering Satan’s lies that blind people, and help others know the true God. (Isa. 43:10)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Isaiah 43:10: “‘You are my witnesses,’ declares Jehovah, ‘yes, my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and have faith in me and understand that I am the same One. Before me no God was formed, and after me there has been none.’”

                    8. What is one way we can glorify Jehovah?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    We can glorify Jehovah by speaking about Him—singing, praising His name, proclaiming His salvation, and declaring His glory, as faithful Jews and Christians did. (Ps. 96:1-3)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Psalm 96:1-3: “Sing to Jehovah a new song; sing to Jehovah, all the earth! Sing to Jehovah, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.”

                    9-10. What do you learn from Angelena’s experience?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Angelena’s experience teaches us to courageously defend Jehovah’s reputation. At work, she tactfully countered a colleague’s mockery with a slideshow of her joy as a Witness, softening his attitude. (1 Pet. 3:15)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    1 Peter 3:15: “But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper and deep respect.”

                    11. How have true worshippers throughout history followed the principle found at Psalm 96:8?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    True worshippers have glorified Jehovah with their valuable things, like the Israelites contributing to the temple, disciples supporting Jesus, and Christians giving relief aid, as we do today with donations. (Prov. 3:9)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Proverbs 3:9: “Honor Jehovah with your valuable things, with the firstfruits of all your produce.”

                <div class="question">
                    12. How can our donations bring glory to Jehovah?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Donations bring glory to Jehovah by supporting His work, as seen with Prisca in Zimbabwe, whose faith during a drought led neighbors to learn about Jehovah after she received relief supplies.

                <div class="question">
                    13. How can our conduct bring glory to Jehovah?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Our conduct brings glory to Jehovah by reflecting His qualities, stripping off the old personality, and adopting the new personality of clean attitudes and actions. (Col. 3:9-10)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    Colossians 3:9-10: “Do not lie to one another. Strip off the old personality with its practices, and clothe yourselves with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it.”

                <div class="answer">
                    Jack’s experience shows that our conduct can glorify Jehovah. A violent man, Jack changed through a Bible study, qualified for baptism, and impressed prison guards, leading another inmate to worship Jehovah. (1 Pet. 2:12)
                </div>
                <div class="scripture">
                    1 Peter 2:12: “Maintain your conduct fine among the nations, so that when they accuse you of being wrongdoers, they may be eyewitnesses of your fine works and, as a result, glorify God in the day of his inspection.”
