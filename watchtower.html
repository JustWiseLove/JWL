            1. Many today focus on what?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Many today focus on themselves, being self-absorbed, such as drawing attention to their accomplishments on social media instead of giving glory to Jehovah. (Ps. 96:8)
        </div>
        <div class="scripture">
            Psalm 96:8 (NWT 2013): “Give Jehovah the glory due his name; bring a gift and come into his courtyards.”
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            2. How did Jehovah reveal his glory at Mount Sinai?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Jehovah revealed his glory at Mount Sinai with a powerful display: a dark cloud, earthquake, lightning, thunder, and a loud horn, impressing the Israelites. (Ex. 19:16-18; 24:17; Ps. 68:8)
        </div>
        <div class="scripture">
            Exodus 19:16-18 (NWT 2013): “On the third day when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a heavy cloud on the mountain, and a very loud sound of a horn, so that all the people in the camp trembled. Moses now brought the people out of the camp to meet the true God, and they took their place at the base of the mountain. Mount Sinai was smoking all over, because Jehovah had come down on it in fire; and its smoke was rising like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain was trembling greatly.”<br>
            Exodus 24:17 (NWT 2013): “The appearance of Jehovah’s glory was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain to the eyes of the people of Israel.”<br>
            Psalm 68:8 (NWT 2013): “The earth quaked, the heavens poured, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.”

        <div class="question">
            3. What does it mean to give Jehovah glory?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            To give Jehovah glory means telling others about His power and qualities and giving Him credit for our accomplishments, as King David did by praising Jehovah’s greatness. (Isa. 26:12; 1 Chron. 29:11, 20)
        </div>
        <div class="scripture">
            Isaiah 26:12 (NWT 2013): “O Jehovah, you will grant us peace, because even all our works you have done for us.”<br>
            1 Chronicles 29:11 (NWT 2013): “Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in the heavens and on the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Jehovah, the one exalting yourself as head over all.”<br>
            1 Chronicles 29:20 (NWT 2013): “Then David said to all the congregation: ‘Now praise Jehovah your God.’ So all the congregation praised Jehovah the God of their forefathers and bowed low and prostrated themselves to Jehovah and to the king.”

        <div class="question">
            4. How did Jesus give glory to Jehovah?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Jesus gave glory to Jehovah by acknowledging Him as the Source of his miracles and by compassionately healing others, like a woman bent double for 18 years, who then glorified God. (Mark 5:18-20; Luke 13:10-13)
        </div>
        <div class="scripture">
            Mark 5:18-20 (NWT 2013): “Now as he was boarding the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed pleaded to go with him. However, he did not let him but said to him: ‘Go home to your relatives, and report to them all the things Jehovah has done for you and the mercy he has shown you.’ So he went away and started to proclaim in the Decapolis all the things Jesus had done for him, and all the people were amazed.”<br>
            Luke 13:10-13 (NWT 2013): “Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. And look! a woman was there who had had a spirit of weakness for 18 years; and she was bent double and was unable to straighten up at all. When Jesus saw her, he called her to him and said: ‘Woman, you are released from your weakness.’ And he laid his hands on her, and instantly she straightened up and began glorifying God.”

        <div class="question">
            5. What reasons do we have to respect Jehovah?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            We respect Jehovah because He is almighty, wise, the Source of life, loyal, successful, and keeps His promises, as Jeremiah said, there is no one like Him. (Ps. 96:4-7; Rev. 4:11; 15:4; Josh. 23:14; Jer. 10:6, 7)
        </div>
        <div class="scripture">
            Psalm 96:4-7 (NWT 2013): “For Jehovah is great and most worthy of praise; he is more awe-inspiring than all other gods. For all the gods of the peoples are worthless gods, but Jehovah is the one who made the heavens. In his presence are majesty and splendor; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. Ascribe to Jehovah, you families of the peoples, ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength.”<br>
            Revelation 4:11 (NWT 2013): “You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they came into existence and were created.”<br>
            Revelation 15:4 (NWT 2013): “Who will not really fear you, Jehovah, and glorify your name, for you alone are loyal? For all the nations will come and worship before you, because your righteous decrees have been revealed.”<br>
            Joshua 23:14 (NWT 2013): “Now look! I am about to die, and you well know with all your heart and with all your soul that not one word out of all the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you; not one word of them has failed.”<br>
            Jeremiah 10:6, 7 (NWT 2013): “There is none like you, O Jehovah. You are great, and your name is great in mightiness. Who should not fear you, O King of the nations? For it is fitting, because, among all the wise ones of the nations and among all their kingdoms, there is no one like you.”

        <div class="question">
            6. Why do we love Jehovah?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            We love Jehovah for His mercy, compassion, empathy, approachability, and humility, as He feels our hurt, draws us close, and lifts the lowly. (Ps. 103:13; Isa. 49:15; Zech. 2:8; Ps. 25:14; Acts 17:27; Ps. 113:6, 7; Ps. 86:12)
        </div>
        <div class="scripture">
            Psalm 103:13 (NWT 2013): “As a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those who fear him.”<br>
            Isaiah 49:15 (NWT 2013): “Can a woman forget her nursing child, or have no compassion for the son of her womb? Even if these women forget, I would never forget you.”<br>
            Zechariah 2:8 (NWT 2013): “For this is what Jehovah of armies says, who after receiving glory sent me to the nations that were plundering you: ‘Whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye.’”<br>
            Psalm 25:14 (NWT 2013): “The confidential talk of Jehovah is with those who fear him, and he makes his covenant known to them.”<br>
            Acts 17:27 (NWT 2013): “so that they would seek God, if they might grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us.”<br>
            Psalm 113:6, 7 (NWT 2013): “He stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth. He raises the lowly one from the dust; he lifts up the poor one from the ash heap.”<br>
            Psalm 86:12 (NWT 2013): “I will glorify your name forever.”
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            7. What special opportunity do we have?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            We have the opportunity to set the record straight about Jehovah, countering Satan’s lies that blind people, and help others know the true God. (2 Cor. 4:4; Isa. 43:10)
        </div>
        <div class="scripture">
            2 Corinthians 4:4 (NWT 2013): “among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.”<br>
            Isaiah 43:10 (NWT 2013): “‘You are my witnesses,’ declares Jehovah, ‘yes, my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and have faith in me and understand that I am the same One. Before me no God was formed, and after me there has been none.’”
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            8. What is one way we can glorify Jehovah?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            We can glorify Jehovah by speaking about Him—singing, praising His name, proclaiming His salvation, and declaring His glory, as faithful Jews and Christians did. (Ps. 96:1-3; Dan. 3:16-18; Acts 4:29)
        </div>
        <div class="scripture">
            Psalm 96:1-3 (NWT 2013): “Sing to Jehovah a new song; sing to Jehovah, all the earth! Sing to Jehovah, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.”<br>
            Daniel 3:16-18 (NWT 2013): “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king: ‘O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If it must be, our God whom we serve is able to rescue us from the burning fiery furnace, O king, and to rescue us from your hand. But if he does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold that you have set up.’”<br>
            Acts 4:29 (NWT 2013): “And now, Jehovah, give attention to their threats, and grant to your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness.”

            9-10. What do you learn from Angelena’s experience?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Angelena’s experience teaches us to courageously defend Jehovah’s reputation. At work, she tactfully countered a colleague’s mockery of her beliefs with a slideshow of her joy as a Witness, softening his attitude and showing the honor of speaking up for Jehovah. (1 Pet. 3:15)
        </div>
        <div class="scripture">
            1 Peter 3:15 (NWT 2013): “But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper and deep respect.”

            11. How have true worshippers throughout history followed the principle found at Psalm 96:8?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            True worshippers have glorified Jehovah with their valuable things, like the Israelites contributing to the temple, disciples supporting Jesus, and Christians giving relief aid, as we do today with donations. (Ps. 96:8; Prov. 3:9; 2 Ki. 12:4, 5; 1 Chron. 29:3-9; Luke 8:1-3; Acts 11:27-29)
        </div>
        <div class="scripture">
            Psalm 96:8 (NWT 2013): “Give Jehovah the glory due his name; bring a gift and come into his courtyards.”<br>
            Proverbs 3:9 (NWT 2013): “Honor Jehovah with your valuable things, with the firstfruits of all your produce.”<br>
            2 Kings 12:4, 5 (NWT 2013): “Jehoash said to the priests: ‘All the money for the holy offerings that is brought to the house of Jehovah—the money for the poll tax, the money for the valuation of a person, and all the money that a man’s heart moves him to bring to the house of Jehovah—let the priests take, each from his acquaintance, and let them repair the damage to the house, wherever damage is found.’”<br>
            1 Chronicles 29:3-9 (NWT 2013): “Moreover, because I take delight in the house of my God, I have given my private treasure of gold and silver to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house: 3,000 talents of gold from the gold of Ophir and 7,000 talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses; gold for the gold things and silver for the silver things and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now who will volunteer to fill his hand with a gift for Jehovah today?’ Then the princes of the paternal houses, the princes of the tribes of Israel, the chiefs of thousands and of hundreds, and the chiefs of the king’s work volunteered. They gave to the service of the house of God 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of copper, and 100,000 talents of iron. And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of Jehovah under the care of Jehiel the Gershonite. So the people rejoiced over their volunteering, for they made voluntary offerings to Jehovah with a complete heart, and David the king also rejoiced greatly.”<br>
            Luke 8:1-3 (NWT 2013): “Shortly afterward he traveled from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God. And the Twelve were with him, as well as certain women who had been cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses: Mary, who is called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out; Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward; Susanna; and many other women, who were ministering to them from their belongings.”<br>
            Acts 11:27-29 (NWT 2013): “In those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. One of them named Agabus stood up and indicated through the spirit that a great famine was about to come on the entire inhabited earth, which, in fact, did take place in the time of Claudius. So the disciples determined, each according to what he could afford, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.”

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Donations bring glory to Jehovah by supporting His work, as seen with Prisca in Zimbabwe, whose faith during a drought led neighbors to learn about Jehovah after she received relief supplies.

            13. How can our conduct bring glory to Jehovah?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Our conduct brings glory to Jehovah by reflecting His qualities, stripping off the old personality, and adopting the new personality of clean attitudes and actions. (Ps. 96:9; Ex. 40:30-32; Ps. 24:3, 4; 1 Pet. 1:15, 16; Col. 3:9, 10)
        </div>

            Psalm 96:9 (NWT 2013): “Worship Jehovah in holy adornment; tremble before him, all the earth.”<br>
            Exodus 40:30-32 (NWT 2013): “He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing. Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet there. Whenever they went into the tent of meeting or approached the altar, they would wash, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.”<br>
            Psalm 24:3, 4 (NWT 2013): “Who may ascend to the mountain of Jehovah, and who may stand in his holy place? Anyone with clean hands and a pure heart, who has not sworn a false oath by my life nor taken an oath deceitfully.”<br>
            1 Peter 1:15, 16 (NWT 2013): “but like the Holy One who called you, become holy yourselves in all your conduct, for it is written: ‘You must be holy, because I am holy.’”<br>
            Colossians 3:9, 10 (NWT 2013): “Do not lie to one another. Strip off the old personality with its practices, and clothe yourselves with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it.”

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Jack’s experience shows that our conduct can glorify Jehovah. A violent man nicknamed “The Demon,” Jack changed through a Bible study, qualified for baptism, and impressed prison guards with his transformation, leading another inmate to worship Jehovah. (1 Pet. 2:12)
        </div>
        <div class="scripture">

            15. How will Jehovah completely glorify his name in the near future?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Jehovah will glorify His name by executing judgment on Babylon the Great, destroying Satan’s system at Armageddon, and saving those who love Him, until His glory fills the earth. (Ps. 96:10-13; Rev. 17:5, 16; 19:1, 2; Mark 8:38; 2 Thess. 1:6-10; Rev. 20:7-10; Hab. 2:14)

            Psalm 96:10-13 (NWT 2013): “Say among the nations: ‘Jehovah has become King! The earth is firmly established, it cannot be moved.
