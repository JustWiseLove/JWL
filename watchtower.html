            <i>“The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.”—PROV. 9:10.</i><br><br>

            <b><u>FOCUS</u></b><br>
            How to use knowledge, understanding, and discernment to make wise decisions.<br><br>

            <b>1. What challenge do we all face?</b><br>
            Every day we need to make decisions. Some are relatively easy to make, such as what to have for breakfast or when to go to bed. Other matters are more difficult to decide. They may affect our health, our happiness, our loved ones, or our worship. We want our decisions to benefit us and our family. Above all, we hope that our decisions will please Jehovah.—Rom. 12:1, 2.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Romans 12:1, 2: “Therefore, I appeal to you by the compassions of God, brothers, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason. And stop being molded by this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, so that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”</i></div><br>

            <b>2. What steps will help you make wise decisions?</b><br>
            You are more likely to make a wise decision if you (1) get the facts, (2) consider Jehovah’s thinking on the matter, and (3) weigh the options. This article will discuss those steps, and it will also help us see how we can train our powers of discernment.—Prov. 2:11.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 2:11: “Then sound judgment will safeguard you, and discernment will protect you.”</i></div><br>

            <b>3. Illustrate why you need to get the facts before you make a decision.</b><br>
            The first step toward making a good decision is to get the facts. Why is this important? Imagine that a patient consults a doctor regarding a serious medical problem. Would the doctor make a decision about a course of treatment without first examining the patient or asking him questions? Certainly not. You too will make better decisions if you first consider the facts that have a bearing on the situation at hand. How can you do that?<br><br>

            <b>4. In harmony with Proverbs 18:13, how can you make sure that you know the facts?</b><br>
            You can often get the facts by asking questions. Suppose you are invited to a social gathering. Should you attend? If you are not acquainted with the host or the arrangements, you will need to ask him such questions as: “Where and when will the gathering be held? How large will it be? Who will supervise it? Who will attend? What activities are planned? Will alcoholic drinks be served?” The answers to these questions will help you to make a wise decision.—Read Proverbs 18:13.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 18:13: “When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, it is foolish and humiliating.”</i></div><br>

            <b>5. What should you do once you have the facts?</b><br>
            Next, facts in hand, look carefully at the full picture. For example, what if you learn that individuals who have no regard for Bible principles will attend the gathering or that alcoholic beverages will be served without supervision? Do you see the potential for this gathering to turn into a wild party? (1 Pet. 4:3) On the other hand, what if the timing of the gathering conflicts with your scheduled congregation meeting or field ministry? When you have seen the whole picture, you will be well on your way to making a good decision. But there is another step that you should take. You know how you see the situation; but how does Jehovah feel about it?—Prov. 2:6.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>1 Peter 4:3: “For the time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have done the will of the nations when you carried on in acts of brazen conduct, unbridled passions, overdrinking, wild parties, drinking bouts, and lawless idolatries.”</i><br>
            <i>Proverbs 2:6: “For Jehovah himself gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and discernment.”</i></div><br>

            <b>6. According to James 1:5, why should we pray for Jehovah’s help?</b><br>
            Ask Jehovah to help you understand his thinking. Jehovah promises to give us the wisdom to discern whether a certain path will please him. He gives such wisdom “generously to all and without reproaching.”—Read James 1:5.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>James 1:5: “So if any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God, for he gives generously to all and without reproaching, and it will be given him.”</i></div><br>

            <b>7. How can you acquire Jehovah’s thinking? Illustrate.</b><br>
            Once you have prayed for Jehovah’s direction, pay careful attention to his answer. To illustrate: If you got lost while traveling, you might ask a local resident for help. But would you then walk away before he had a chance to reply? Of course not. You would listen carefully to his directions. Similarly, after you ask Jehovah for wisdom, try to discern his answer by finding out which Bible laws and principles apply to your situation. For example, when deciding whether to attend the social gathering mentioned earlier, you might consider what the Bible says about wild parties, bad associations, and the need to put Kingdom interests ahead of your personal preferences.—Matt. 6:33; Rom. 13:13; 1 Cor. 15:33.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Matthew 6:33: “Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.”</i><br>
            <i>Romans 13:13: “Let us walk with decency as in the daytime, not in wild parties and drunkenness, not in immoral intercourse and brazen conduct, not in strife and jealousy.”</i><br>
            <i>1 Corinthians 15:33: “Do not be misled. Bad associations spoil useful habits.”</i></div><br>

            <b>8. What can you do if you need help to find the information you are looking for?</b><br>
            Still, at times you may need help to find the information you are looking for. You might get input from an experienced brother or sister. However, you will also benefit from doing your own research. There is a wealth of information in our study tools, such as the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses and Scriptures for Christian Living. Remember the goal: to make a decision that will please Jehovah.<br><br>

            <b>9. How can we be sure that our decision will please Jehovah? (Ephesians 5:17)</b><br>
            How can we be sure that our decision will please Jehovah? First of all, we need to get to know him well. “Knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding,” the Bible says. (Prov. 9:10) Yes, true understanding comes from knowing Jehovah’s qualities, his purpose, and what he loves or hates. Ask yourself, ‘Knowing what I do about Jehovah, what decision can I make that will please him?’—Read Ephesians 5:17.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 9:10: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.”</i><br>
            <i>Ephesians 5:17: “So keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord.”</i></div><br>

            <b>10. Why are Bible principles more important than family tradition or local culture?</b><br>
            In order to please Jehovah, we must at times disappoint those who are close to us. For example, some well-meaning parents may insist that their adult daughter marry a man who is financially well-off—or one who can pay them a large dowry—even though he is not spiritually strong. True, they want their daughter to be cared for materially, but who will help her to progress as a spiritual person? How does Jehovah view the matter? We find the answer at Matthew 6:33. There, Christians are urged to keep “seeking first the Kingdom.” Although we honor our parents and respect the people in our community, our main concern is to make Jehovah happy.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Matthew 6:33: “Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.”</i></div><br>

            <b>11. What quality discussed at Philippians 1:9, 10 will help you to weigh your options?</b><br>
            Once you have considered the Bible principles involved in your decision, you need to evaluate your options. (Read Philippians 1:9, 10; see study note on “full discernment.”) The quality of discernment will enable you to perceive the potential outcome of each option. Sometimes the decision can be easily made. But not all decisions are that straightforward. Discernment will help you to make wise decisions even in complex situations.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Philippians 1:9, 10: “And this is what I continue praying, that your love may abound still more and more with accurate knowledge and full discernment; that you may make sure of the more important things, so that you may be flawless and not stumbling others up to the day of Christ.”</i></div><br>

            <b>12-13. How can discernment help you make a wise decision regarding secular employment?</b><br>
            Consider this scenario. You are looking for a job to support your family. Two jobs are available. You review all the facts, taking note of the type of work, the schedule, the travel time, and so on. In both cases, the work itself is Scripturally acceptable. Perhaps you favor one option because you prefer the type of work or because the salary is higher. There are other factors, though, to consider before making a decision. For example, would either job conflict with your congregation meeting schedule? Would either job cut into the time you need to care for your family’s emotional and spiritual needs? Asking such questions will help you to put “the more important things”—your worship and your family’s needs—ahead of material advantages. Then you can reach a decision that Jehovah will bless.<br><br>

            <b>14. How will using discernment and showing love help us to avoid stumbling others?</b><br>
            Discernment also moves us to consider how our decision might affect other people so that we can avoid “stumbling others.” (Phil. 1:10) This is important when we make personal decisions in such areas as dress and grooming. For example, we may prefer a particular style of clothing or grooming. But what if others inside or outside the congregation would be offended by it? Discernment will help us to respect their feelings. Love will motivate us to seek the advantage of “the other person” and to be modest. (1 Cor. 10:23, 24, 32; 1 Tim. 2:9, 10) We will then make a decision that reflects our love and respect for others.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Philippians 1:10: “That you may make sure of the more important things, so that you may be flawless and not stumbling others up to the day of Christ.”</i><br>
            <i>1 Corinthians 10:23, 24: “All things are lawful, but not all things are advantageous. All things are lawful, but not all things build up. Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.”</i><br>
            <i>1 Corinthians 10:32: “Keep from becoming causes for stumbling to Jews as well as Greeks and to the congregation of God.”</i><br>
            <i>1 Timothy 2:9, 10: “Likewise, I desire the women to adorn themselves in well-arranged dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive clothing, but in the way that is proper for women professing devotion to God, namely, through good works.”</i></div><br>

            <b>15. What planning is needed before implementing a major decision?</b><br>
            If you are making a major decision, think about what it would take to implement it. Jesus taught us to “calculate the expense.” (Luke 14:28) So consider the amount of time, resources, and effort that you would need to invest to make the decision work. In some cases, you might consult your family to determine what each member would need to do to support the decision. Why is this kind of planning valuable? It may reveal that your decision needs some adjustments or that a different option is more practical. And when you involve your family members and listen to their input, they will more readily work with you to make the decision succeed.—Prov. 15:22.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Luke 14:28: “For example, who of you wanting to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it?”</i><br>
            <i>Proverbs 15:22: “Plans fail when there is no consultation, but there is accomplishment through many advisers.”</i></div><br>

            <b>16. What steps will help you to make a decision that will succeed?</b><br>
            If you have followed the steps outlined above, you are ready to make a wise decision. You have obtained the facts and examined the principles that will help you make a decision that is pleasing to Jehovah. Now you can ask Jehovah to help you make your decision succeed.<br><br>

            <b>17. What is the key to making good decisions?</b><br>
            Even if you have made many successful decisions in the past, remember that the key to making good decisions is to rely, not on your own intelligence or experience, but on the wisdom from Jehovah. He alone can give you true knowledge, understanding, and discernment—the building blocks of wisdom. (Prov. 2:1-5) Jehovah can help you to make decisions that please him.—Ps. 23:2, 3.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 2:1-5: “My son, if you accept my sayings and treasure up my commandments, by making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to discernment, if you call out for understanding and raise your voice for discernment, if you keep seeking for it as for silver, and you keep searching for it as for hidden treasures, then you will understand the fear of Jehovah, and you will find the knowledge of God.”</i><br>
            <i>Psalm 23:2, 3: “In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; he leads me to well-watered resting-places. He refreshes my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of his name.”</i></div><br>

            <b>WHAT DO THESE SCRIPTURES TEACH YOU ABOUT MAKING GOOD DECISIONS?<br>
            Proverbs 18:13</b><br>
            When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, it is foolish and humiliating. We should get the facts before making a decision.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 18:13: “When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, it is foolish and humiliating.”</i></div><br>

            <b>WHAT DO THESE SCRIPTURES TEACH YOU ABOUT MAKING GOOD DECISIONS?<br>
            Ephesians 5:17</b><br>
            We should make sure of what is acceptable to Jehovah by considering his will when making decisions.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Ephesians 5:17: “So keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord.”</i></div><br>

            <b>WHAT DO THESE SCRIPTURES TEACH YOU ABOUT MAKING GOOD DECISIONS?<br>
            Philippians 1:9, 10</b><br>
            We should use discernment to make sure of the more important things, ensuring our decisions don’t stumble others and align with Jehovah’s standards.<br>

        <!-- Article 2: Husbands, Honor Your Wife -->
        <div class="article-title" onclick="toggleArticle(this)">Husbands, Honor Your Wife</div>
        <div class="article-content">
            <i>“You husbands, . . . assign them honor.”—1 PET. 3:7.</i><br><br>

            <b><u>FOCUS</u></b><br>
            How a husband can honor his wife in word and action.<br><br>

            <b>1. What is one reason why Jehovah created the marriage arrangement?</b><br>
            Jehovah created marriage to bring joy, as He is the happy God and wants us to enjoy life through a close bond of love and respect. (Prov. 5:18)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 5:18: “Let your water source be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth.”</i></div><br>

            <b>2. What is the state of many marriages today?</b><br>
            Many marriages today are unhappy because couples forget their wedding promises, with husbands often abusing their wives physically, verbally, or emotionally, or viewing pornography.<br><br>

            <b>3. What factors can contribute to a husband’s abusive behavior?</b><br>
            Factors include being raised by a violent father, cultural ideas that a man must use force, lack of emotional control, a warped view from pornography, and intensified issues from the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>

            <b>4. What do Christian husbands need to guard against, and why?</b><br>
            Christian husbands must guard against adopting improper views of women, as thoughts lead to actions, and worldly thinking can influence them to abuse their wives. (Rom. 12:2)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Romans 12:2: “Stop being molded by this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, so that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”</i></div><br>

            <b>5. According to 1 Peter 3:7, how should a husband treat his wife?</b><br>
            A husband should honor his wife, treating her with kindness and love, as honoring her respects Jehovah’s command. (1 Pet. 3:7)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>1 Peter 3:7: “You husbands, in the same way, continue dwelling with them according to knowledge. Assign them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since they are also heirs with you of the undeserved favor of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.”</i></div><br>

            <b>6. How does Jehovah feel about men who physically abuse their wife?</b><br>
            Jehovah hates violence and condemns husbands who abuse their wives, as it affects their relationship with Him, possibly hindering their prayers. (Col. 3:19)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Colossians 3:19: “You husbands, keep on loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them.”</i></div><br>

            <b>7. According to Ephesians 4:31, 32, what type of speech must husbands avoid?</b><br>
            Husbands must avoid angry, hurtful speech like screaming and abusive words, as Jehovah hates such speech and it damages their marriage and relationship with Him. (Eph. 4:31)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Ephesians 4:31: “Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from you along with all badness.”</i></div><br>

            <b>8. How does Jehovah feel about pornography, and why?</b><br>
            Jehovah hates pornography because it damages a husband’s relationship with Him and degrades his wife, as Jesus said a man who looks lustfully commits adultery in his heart. (Matt. 5:28)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Matthew 5:28: “But I say to you that everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”</i></div><br>

            <b>9. Why does Jehovah hate it when a husband is sexually demeaning toward his wife?</b><br>
            Jehovah hates sexually demeaning behavior because it’s cold and thoughtless, and He expects husbands to love, cherish, and respect their wife’s feelings. (Eph. 5:28)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Ephesians 5:28: “In this way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself.”</i></div><br>

            <b>10. How can husbands benefit from Jesus’ example?</b><br>
            Husbands can overcome abusive behavior by imitating Jesus, who treated his disciples with kindness and dignity, serving as a model for loving their wives. (Eph. 5:25)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Ephesians 5:25: “Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it.”</i></div><br>

            <b>11. How did Jesus treat his apostles?</b><br>
            Jesus treated his apostles kindly, never harshly, humbly serving them and showing mildness and restraint, even as their Master. (Matt. 11:29)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Matthew 11:29: “Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for yourselves.”</i></div><br>

            <b>12. How did Jesus speak to others?</b><br>
            Jesus spoke to comfort and refresh others, never harshly, even remaining silent when provoked rather than insulting in return. (1 Pet. 2:23)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>1 Peter 2:23: “When he was being insulted, he did not insult in return; when he was suffering, he did not threaten, but he entrusted himself to the One who judges righteously.”</i></div><br>

            A husband can “stick to his wife” by being loyal, as if glued to her, rejecting pornography and not looking lustfully at other women. (Matt. 19:5; Job 31:1)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Matthew 19:5: “And said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh’?”</i><br>

            <b>14. What steps should an abusive husband take to repair his relationship with Jehovah and with his wife?</b><br>
            An abusive husband should: recognize his problem, stop the abuse, apologize to his wife and Jehovah, seek forgiveness, pray for help, hate violence, seek elders’ help, and plan to avoid such behavior. (Prov. 28:13; Jas. 5:14)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 28:13: “The one covering over his transgressions will not succeed, but whoever confesses and abandons them will be shown mercy.”</i><br>

            <b>15. How can a husband show affection for his wife?</b><br>
            A husband can show affection through small acts like holding her hand, giving a warm embrace, or sending a loving message, strengthening their marriage. (1 John 3:18)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>1 John 3:18: “Little children, we should love, not in word or with the tongue, but in deed and truth.”</i></div><br>

            <b>16. Why should a husband praise his wife?</b><br>
            A husband should praise his wife to build her up, making her feel secure, loved, and honored for her support. (Prov. 31:28)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 31:28: “Her children rise up and declare her happy; her husband praises her.”</i></div><br>

            <b>17. How can a husband show respect for his wife?</b><br>
            A husband shows respect by valuing his wife as a priceless gift, treating her kindly, and not pressuring her into demeaning sexual acts. (Prov. 18:22)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 18:22: “The one who finds a good wife has found something good, and he receives Jehovah’s favor.”</i></div><br>

            <b>18. What should husbands be determined to do?</b><br>
            Husbands should be determined to honor their wife by avoiding dishonorable conduct and being kind, respectful, and affectionate, protecting their relationship with Jehovah. (Ps. 25:14)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Psalm 25:14: “The confidential talk of Jehovah is with those who fear him, and he makes his covenant known to them.”</i></div><br>

            <i>OUR YEARTEXT FOR 2025: “Give Jehovah the glory due his name.”—PS. 96:8.</i><br><br>

            <b><u>FOCUS</u></b><br>
            Learning how we can give Jehovah the glory he deserves.<br><br>

            <b>1. Many today focus on what?</b><br>
            Many today focus on themselves, being self-absorbed, such as drawing attention to their accomplishments on social media instead of giving glory to Jehovah.<br><br>

            <b>2. How did Jehovah reveal his glory at Mount Sinai?</b><br>
            Jehovah revealed his glory at Mount Sinai with a powerful display: a dark cloud, earthquake, lightning, thunder, and a loud horn, impressing the Israelites. (Ex. 19:16-18)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Exodus 19:16-18: “On the third day when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a heavy cloud on the mountain, and a very loud sound of a horn, so that all the people in the camp trembled. Moses now brought the people out of the camp to meet the true God, and they took their place at the base of the mountain. Mount Sinai was smoking all over, because Jehovah had come down on it in fire; and its smoke was rising like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain was trembling greatly.”</i></div><br>

            <b>3. What does it mean to give Jehovah glory?</b><br>
            To give Jehovah glory means telling others about His power and qualities and giving Him credit for our accomplishments, as King David did by praising Jehovah’s greatness. (1 Chron. 29:11)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>1 Chronicles 29:11: “Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in the heavens and on the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Jehovah, the one exalting yourself as head over all.”</i></div><br>

            <b>4. How did Jesus give glory to Jehovah?</b><br>
            Jesus gave glory to Jehovah by acknowledging Him as the Source of his miracles and by compassionately healing others, like a woman bent double for 18 years, who then glorified God. (Luke 13:12-13)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Luke 13:12-13: “When Jesus saw her, he called her to him and said: ‘Woman, you are released from your weakness.’ And he laid his hands on her, and instantly she straightened up and began glorifying God.”</i></div><br>

            <b>5. What reasons do we have to respect Jehovah?</b><br>
            We respect Jehovah because He is almighty, wise, the Source of life, loyal, successful, and keeps His promises, as Jeremiah said, there is no one like Him. (Jer. 10:6)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Jeremiah 10:6: “There is none like you, O Jehovah. You are great, and your name is great in mightiness.”</i></div><br>

            <b>6. Why do we love Jehovah?</b><br>
            We love Jehovah for His mercy, compassion, empathy, approachability, and humility, as He feels our hurt, draws us close, and lifts the lowly. (Ps. 103:13)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Psalm 103:13: “As a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those who fear him.”</i></div><br>

            <b>7. What special opportunity do we have?</b><br>
            We have the opportunity to set the record straight about Jehovah, countering Satan’s lies that blind people, and help others know the true God. (Isa. 43:10)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Isaiah 43:10: “‘You are my witnesses,’ declares Jehovah, ‘yes, my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and have faith in me and understand that I am the same One. Before me no God was formed, and after me there has been none.’”</i></div><br>

            <b>8. What is one way we can glorify Jehovah?</b><br>
            We can glorify Jehovah by speaking about Him—singing, praising His name, proclaiming His salvation, and declaring His glory, as faithful Jews and Christians did. (Ps. 96:1-3)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Psalm 96:1-3: “Sing to Jehovah a new song; sing to Jehovah, all the earth! Sing to Jehovah, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.”</i></div><br>

            <b>9-10. What do you learn from Angelena’s experience?</b><br>
            Angelena’s experience teaches us to courageously defend Jehovah’s reputation. At work, she tactfully countered a colleague’s mockery with a slideshow of her joy as a Witness, softening his attitude. (1 Pet. 3:15)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>1 Peter 3:15: “But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper and deep respect.”</i></div><br>

            <b>11. How have true worshippers throughout history followed the principle found at Psalm 96:8?</b><br>
            True worshippers have glorified Jehovah with their valuable things, like the Israelites contributing to the temple, disciples supporting Jesus, and Christians giving relief aid, as we do today with donations. (Prov. 3:9)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 3:9: “Honor Jehovah with your valuable things, with the firstfruits of all your produce.”</i></div><br>

            <b>12. How can our donations bring glory to Jehovah?</b><br>
            Donations bring glory to Jehovah by supporting His work, as seen with Prisca in Zimbabwe, whose faith during a drought led neighbors to learn about Jehovah after she received relief supplies.<br><br>

            <b>13. How can our conduct bring glory to Jehovah?</b><br>
            Our conduct brings glory to Jehovah by reflecting His qualities, stripping off the old personality, and adopting the new personality of clean attitudes and actions. (Col. 3:9-10)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Colossians 3:9-10: “Do not lie to one another. Strip off the old personality with its practices, and clothe yourselves with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it.”</i></div><br>

            <b>14. What do you learn from Jack’s experience?</b><br>
            Jack’s experience shows that our conduct can glorify Jehovah. A violent man, Jack changed through a Bible study, qualified for baptism, and impressed prison guards, leading another inmate to worship Jehovah. (1 Pet. 2:12)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>1 Peter 2:12: “Maintain your conduct fine among the nations, so that when they accuse you of being wrongdoers, they may be eyewitnesses of your fine works and, as a result, glorify God in the day of his inspection.”</i></div><br>

            <b>15. How will Jehovah completely glorify his name in the near future?</b><br>
            Jehovah will glorify His name by executing judgment on Babylon the Great, destroying Satan’s system at Armageddon, and saving those who love Him, until His glory fills the earth. (Hab. 2:14)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Habakkuk 2:14: “For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.”</i></div><br>

            <b>16. What are you determined to do?</b><br>
            I am determined to glorify Jehovah at every opportunity until everyone alive gives Him the glory due His name, as emphasized by the 2025 yeartext.<br><br>

            <b>HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER?<br>
            What does it mean to give Jehovah glory?</b><br>

            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>1 Chronicles 29:11: “Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in the heavens and on the earth is yours.

            How can we give Jehovah the glory he deserves?</b><br>
