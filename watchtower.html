                        <h2>(1st–2nd Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>After the apostles’ death, false worship infiltrated Christianity, as “savage wolves” emerged (Acts 20:29). Satan, “the father of the lie” (John 8:44), blended paganism with truth, obscuring Jehovah’s name and worship.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ignatius of Antioch (d. c. 110 CE):</strong> Ignatius promoted a clergy-laity divide, calling bishops superior, contradicting “You are all brothers” (Matthew 23:8). His letters, preserved in historical records, introduced unscriptural hierarchies, aligning with Babylonian priestly systems.</p>
                        <p><strong>Polycarp of Smyrna (d. c. 155 CE):</strong> A faithful disciple of John, Polycarp resisted pagan festivals like Saturnalia, declaring, “I am a Christian,” before his martyrdom by burning. His stand, documented in early Christian texts, upheld Jehovah’s truth against Roman persecution under Nero (64 CE), as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <p><strong>Gnosticism and Marcion:</strong> Gnostics denied Jehovah’s sovereignty, promoting Babylonian star worship, while Marcion (c. 140 CE) rejected Hebrew Scriptures, furthering apostasy. The Septuagint, retaining “YHWH,” countered these errors, fulfilling “The truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p>
                        <h2>Faithful Resistance</h2>
                        <p>Polycarp’s courage preserved true worship’s foundation, resisting Satan’s schemes, as “the god of this system blinds the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4). His sacrifice foreshadowed future restorers.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” — Revelation 2:10</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Constantine and Arius at Nicaea</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(4th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Council of Nicaea (325 CE) marked a pinnacle of apostasy, as “Babylon the Great” corrupted worship (Revelation 17:5). Constantine, a political opportunist, merged paganism with Christianity, obscuring Jehovah’s name.</p>
                        <p><strong>Constantine (272–337 CE):</strong> As Roman emperor, Constantine convened Nicaea, adopting the Trinity, a Babylonian concept, using “homoousios” to equate Jesus with God, contradicting “I am Jehovah, there is no other” (Isaiah 45:5). He replaced “YHWH” with “Lord,” defying “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). His Edict of Milan (313 CE), preserved in historical records, feigned tolerance while promoting pagan festivals like Christmas, rooted in Mithra’s birthday (Jeremiah 10:2).</p>
                        <p><strong>Arius (256–336 CE):</strong> Arius, a presbyter, upheld Jesus as “the firstborn of creation” (Colossians 1:15), rejecting the Trinity. Exiled by Nicaea’s bishops, his writings, preserved in early texts, influenced later truth-seekers. His stand risked death, as “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p>
                        <p><strong>Codex Vaticanus (c. 350 CE):</strong> This Greek manuscript, stored in the Vatican Library, preserved Hebrew Scripture texts with “YHWH” traces, ensuring “My words will not pass away” (Matthew 24:35).</p>
                        <h2>Resisting Paganism</h2>
                        <p>Arius’s courage against Constantine’s decrees preserved truth’s spark, complementing artifacts like the Septuagint in vindicating Jehovah’s name.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I am Jehovah, that is my name.” — Isaiah 42:8</p>

                        <h2>(4th–14th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>Despite Catholic efforts to suppress scripture, as “the dragon was enraged” (Revelation 12:17), faithful individuals ensured the Bible’s survival, preserving Jehovah’s Word.</p>
                        <p><strong>Jerome (347–420 CE):</strong> Jerome translated the Latin Vulgate (405 CE), using Hebrew and Greek texts with “YHWH.” Despite Catholic errors, his work, preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, kept scripture accessible, as “the word of God is not bound” (2 Timothy 2:9).</p>
                        <p><strong>Waldensians (12th Century):</strong> Led by Peter Waldo, the Waldensians translated vernacular Bibles, defying Catholic bans. Persecuted as heretics, they hid manuscripts in the Alps, as documented in historical records. Their translations, echoing “You must worship with spirit and truth” (John 4:24), reached the poor, preserving truth.</p>
                        <p><strong>Codex Alexandrinus (c. 450 CE):</strong> This manuscript, in the British Library, London, retained “YHWH” in Septuagint portions, supporting faithful scribes. Cairo Geniza fragments (9th century), in Cambridge University Library, UK, further preserved “YHWH.”</p>
                        <h2>Enduring Persecution</h2>
                        <p>Jerome’s scholarship and the Waldensians’ bravery ensured scripture’s survival, complementing artifacts like the Aleppo Codex in vindicating Jehovah’s name.</p>

                        <h2>(14th–16th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Reformation saw courageous individuals risk death to translate and restore Jehovah’s Word, breaking Catholic chains, as “those in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another” (Malachi 3:16).</p>
                        <p><strong>John Wycliffe (1328–1384):</strong> Wycliffe translated the first English Bible (1382) from the Vulgate, inspiring vernacular access. Declared a heretic, his bones were burned posthumously, but his work, in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, spread truth, as “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <p><strong>Jan Hus (1369–1415):</strong> A Bohemian reformer, Hus preached Bible truth, rejecting indulgences. Burned at the stake in 1415, his writings, preserved in historical archives, influenced Luther, fulfilling “The truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p>
                        <p><strong>William Tyndale (1494–1536):</strong> Tyndale’s English Pentateuch (1530) used “Jehovah” (e.g., Exodus 6:3), defying Catholic bans. Strangled and burned in 1536, his translations, in the British Library, London, shaped the King James Version, as “declare his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24).</p>
                        <p><strong>Index of Forbidden Books (1559):</strong> The Catholic Church banned vernacular Bibles, but these translators’ efforts endured, supported by manuscripts like the Leningrad Codex.</p>
                        <h2>Sacrifices for Truth</h2>
                        <p>Wycliffe, Hus, and Tyndale’s martyrdom restored access to Jehovah’s Word, complementing translations like the King James Version in vindicating His name.</p>

                        <p>Before the Bible Students, individuals rejected false doctrines, laying the groundwork for pure worship, as “Jehovah searches for those loyal to him” (2 Chronicles 16:9).</p>
                        <p><strong>Henry Ainsworth (1571–1622):</strong> A Puritan scholar, Ainsworth used “Jehovah” in his Psalms annotations (1612), citing Psalm 83:18. Exiled for his beliefs, his work, in the British Library, London, influenced later translators, as “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1).</p>
                        <p><strong>Henry Grew (1781–1862):</strong> A Baptist minister, Grew rejected the Trinity and hellfire, teaching “Jehovah” as God’s name. His pamphlets, preserved in historical archives, influenced Charles Taze Russell, fulfilling “The dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5).</p>
                        <p><strong>George Storrs (1796–1879):</strong> Storrs taught earthly resurrection and no immortal soul, publishing *Six Sermons*. Persecuted for his views, his writings, in the British Museum, London, shaped the Bible Students, as “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11).</p>
                        <p><strong>Supporting Artifacts:</strong> The Aleppo Codex (930 CE), with 6,973 “YHWH” instances, and Lachish Letters (590 BCE), mentioning “YHWH,” both in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, validated their efforts.</p>

                        <p>Charles Taze Russell spearheaded the restoration of pure worship, rejecting false religion, as “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p><strong>Charles Taze Russell (1852–1916):</strong> Influenced by Grew and Storrs, Russell rejected Trinity, hellfire, and immortal soul doctrines. In 1870, he formed a Bible study group in Pittsburgh, launching *Zion’s Watch Tower* (1879) to publish truth. He wrote *Studies in the Scriptures*, distributing millions of tracts, often at churches, defying clergy opposition. In 1884, he founded the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. Russell calculated 1914 as Christ’s enthronement (Daniel 4:25, 607 BCE–1914), confirmed by World War I (Matthew 24:7). Persecuted for his preaching, his works, in the British Museum, London, restored Jehovah’s name, as “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10).</p>
                        <p><strong>Early Bible Students:</strong> Russell’s followers, including Maria Ackley and William Conley, distributed tracts door-to-door, facing mob violence but persisting, as “I did not hold back from preaching” (Acts 20:20).</p>
                        <h2>Restoring Pure Worship</h2>
                        <p>Russell’s publications and preaching laid the foundation for Jehovah’s Witnesses, complementing the New World Translation’s restoration of “Jehovah” in vindicating His name.</p>

                        <p>Joseph Franklin Rutherford continued Russell’s work, facing intense persecution to restore pure worship, as “the word of God is alive” (Hebrews 4:12).</p>
                        <p><strong>Joseph Franklin Rutherford (1869–1942):</strong> Succeeding Russell in 1917, Rutherford led the Bible Students amid World War I. In 1918, he and seven associates were falsely charged with sedition for publishing *The Finished Mystery*, criticizing clergy support for war. Imprisoned for nine months in Atlanta, they were released in 1919 after legal victories. Rutherford’s 43 Supreme Court wins, documented in historical records, secured preaching rights. In 1931, he named the group Jehovah’s Witnesses (Isaiah 43:10), emphasizing Jehovah’s name. He oversaw radio broadcasts and conventions, sharing truth globally, as “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1).</p>
                        <p><strong>Persecution:</strong> Bible Students faced arrests and mob attacks for distributing *The Watchtower* at churches and homes, yet persisted, as “be faithful even to death” (Revelation 2:10).</p>
                        <h2>Legal Victories for Worship</h2>
                        <p>Rutherford’s imprisonment and legal battles restored preaching freedoms, complementing artifacts like the Dead Sea Scrolls in vindicating Jehovah’s name.</p>

                        <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses, under modern leaders, have fully restored pure worship, preaching globally, as “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p><strong>Nathan H. Knorr (1905–1977):</strong> Leading from 1942, Knorr oversaw the New World Translation (1950–1961), restoring “Jehovah” 7,237 times, based on the Leningrad Codex. He founded Gilead School (1943) to train missionaries, expanding preaching to 240 lands. His leadership, documented in Watch Tower archives, countered apostate translations, as “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p><strong>Governing Body (1971–Present):</strong> Modeled on Acts 15:2, the Governing Body guides Witnesses, ensuring doctrinal purity. Facing bans, like Russia’s 2017 ban with 2,000 arrests, they persevere, as “Jehovah loves those who love him” (Psalm 31:23).</p>
                        <p><strong>Global Mission:</strong> With 8.7 million Witnesses, 1.4 billion preaching hours, and a website in 1,000+ languages, Witnesses uphold neutrality (John 18:36) and provide disaster relief (e.g., Haiti 2010). The 2019 “Love Never Fails” convention reinforced paradise hope (Revelation 21:5).</p>
                        <h2>Pure Worship Restored</h2>
                        <p>Knorr and the Governing Body’s efforts, supported by artifacts like the Silver Scrolls, ensure pure worship’s global reach, vindicating Jehovah’s name.</p>
