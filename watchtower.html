        <h2>Study Article 1</h2>
        <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> “Give to Jehovah the glory belonging to his name.” — Psalm 96:8</p>
        <p><strong>FOCUS:</strong> We will see how we can glorify Jehovah and why we must avoid doing anything that would bring reproach on his name.</p>

        <h3>1. What does it mean to glorify Jehovah?</h3>
        <p>To glorify Jehovah means to reflect his qualities in our speech and conduct, giving honor to his holy name. As Jesus said in John 17:4: “I have glorified you on the earth, having finished the work you gave me to do.” Like Jesus, we honor Jehovah by obeying His commands and promoting His name.</p>

        <h3>2. How did Jesus give glory to his Father?</h3>
        <p>Jesus glorified Jehovah by making His name known and reflecting His qualities perfectly. He stated: “I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me out of the world.” — John 17:6.</p>

        <h3>3. How can we imitate Jesus in giving glory to Jehovah?</h3>
        <p>We imitate Jesus by actively participating in the ministry, obeying Jehovah’s commands, and conducting ourselves in a holy manner. 1 Peter 2:12 encourages: “Maintain your conduct fine among the nations, so that... they may glorify God.”</p>

        <h3>4. What can damage Jehovah’s reputation?</h3>
        <p>When someone who claims to serve Jehovah lives hypocritically, it brings reproach. Romans 2:24 warns: “The name of God is being blasphemed among the nations because of you.”</p>

        <h3>5. Why is Jehovah’s name so important?</h3>
        <p>Jehovah’s name represents who He is — His reputation and purpose. Psalm 83:18 says: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High.” His name is key to true worship.</p>

        <h3>6. How does our behavior reflect on Jehovah’s name?</h3>
        <p>Our conduct can either glorify or disgrace God’s name. Titus 2:10 says we should “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God,” meaning our lives should make God’s standards appealing.</p>

        <h3>7. How can young ones give glory to Jehovah?</h3>
        <p>Young ones give glory to Jehovah by showing respect for His standards, even when under peer pressure. Proverbs 27:11 says: “Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, so that I can make a reply to him who taunts me.”</p>

        <h3>8. What role does prayer play in glorifying Jehovah?</h3>
        <p>Through prayer, we acknowledge Jehovah’s position and show reliance on Him. Philippians 4:6 says: “In everything by prayer... let your petitions be made known to God.”</p>

        <h3>9. Why should we be determined to avoid bringing reproach on Jehovah’s name?</h3>
        <p>Because we represent Him, our actions impact how others view Jehovah. 2 Corinthians 6:3 states: “We are giving no cause for stumbling, so that our ministry might not be criticized.”</p>

        <h3>10. What blessings come from glorifying Jehovah?</h3>
        <p>Those who glorify Jehovah enjoy His approval, peace of mind, and hope for everlasting life. John 12:26 promises: “If anyone ministers to me, the Father will honor him.”</p>
