    <summary>Husbands, Honor Your Wife</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Theme Scripture:</strong><br>“You husbands, . . . assign them honor.” — 1 Peter 3:7</p>
      <p><strong>FOCUS:</strong><br>How a husband can honor his wife in word and action.</p>

      <p class="question">1. What is one reason why Jehovah created the marriage arrangement?</p>
      <p>Jehovah is “the happy God,” and He wants us to be happy too. One of His gifts is marriage, which brings joy when maintained with love and respect.<br><span class="scripture">1 Tim. 1:11; Jas. 1:17; Prov. 5:18</span></p>

      <p class="question">2. What is the state of many marriages today?</p>
      <p>Many couples forget their wedding vows. Abuse and pornography are common, damaging relationships and happiness.</p>

      <p class="question">3. What factors can contribute to a husband’s abusive behavior?</p>
      <p>Some are raised by violent fathers, influenced by harmful cultures, or corrupted by pornography. COVID-19 stress worsened these issues.</p>

      <p class="question">4. What do Christian husbands need to guard against, and why?</p>
      <p>They must avoid worldly thinking. Wrong thoughts can lead to wrong actions. Paul warned Christians not to conform to the world.<br><span class="scripture">Rom. 12:1, 2</span></p>

      <p class="question">5. According to 1 Peter 3:7, how should a husband treat his wife?</p>
      <p>With honor and kindness, reflecting genuine respect. Failing to do so harms his relationship with Jehovah.<br><span class="scripture">1 Peter 3:7</span></p>
