            <i>“By this the love of God was revealed.”—1 JOHN 4:9.</i><br><br>

            <b><u>FOCUS</u></b><br>
            What the ransom reveals about the appealing qualities of Jehovah God and of Jesus Christ.<br><br>

            <b>1. How do we benefit from attending the annual Memorial of Christ’s death?</b><br>
            Surely you agree that the ransom is a priceless gift! (2 Cor. 9:15) Because Jesus sacrificed his human life, you can have a close friendship with Jehovah God. You can also have the prospect of everlasting life. How fitting it is that we show gratitude for the ransom and for Jehovah, who was moved by love to provide it! (Rom. 5:8) To help us remain grateful and never take the ransom for granted, Jesus instituted the annual Memorial of his death.—Luke 22:19, 20.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>2 Corinthians 9:15: “Thanks be to God for his indescribable free gift.”</i><br>
            <i>Romans 5:8: “But God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”</i><br>
            <i>Luke 22:19, 20: “Also, he took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: ‘This means my body, which is to be given in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.’ Also, he did the same with the cup after they had the evening meal, saying: ‘This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.’”</i></div><br>

            <b>2. What will be discussed in this article?</b><br>
            This year, the Memorial will be observed on Saturday, April 12, 2025. No doubt all of us are planning to attend. We will benefit greatly if we take time during the Memorial season to meditate on what Jehovah and his Son have done for us. In this article, we will discuss what the ransom teaches us about Jehovah and his Son. In the following article, we will be helped to understand how we can benefit from that ransom and how we can show our gratitude for it.<br><br>

            <b>3. How could the death of one man lead to the redemption of millions of people?</b><br>
            The ransom teaches us about Jehovah’s justice. (Deut. 32:4) How so? Consider: From disobedient Adam, we inherited sin that leads to death. (Rom. 5:12) To set us free from sin and death, Jehovah arranged for Jesus to provide the ransom. But how could the sacrifice of one perfect human redeem millions of people? The apostle Paul explains: “Just as through the disobedience of the one man [Adam] many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one person [Jesus] many will be made righteous.” (Rom. 5:19; 1 Tim. 2:6) In other words, it took one disobedient perfect man to cause us to become enslaved to sin and death. Therefore, it took one obedient perfect man to set us free.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Deuteronomy 32:4: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness who is never unjust; righteous and upright is he.”</i><br>
            <i>Romans 5:12: “That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned—.”</i><br>
            <i>Romans 5:19: “For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one person many will be made righteous.”</i><br>
            <i>1 Timothy 2:6: “Who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all—this is what is to be witnessed to in its own due time.”</i></div><br>

            <b>4. Why did Jehovah not simply allow righthearted members of Adam’s offspring to live forever?</b><br>
            Did Jesus really have to die in order to save us? Couldn’t Jehovah have simply decided to allow righthearted members of Adam’s offspring to live forever? To imperfect humans, that would seem to be the kind and reasonable thing to do. But it does not take into account Jehovah’s perfect justice. Because Jehovah is just, he would never choose to ignore Adam’s glaring act of disobedience.<br><br>

            <b>5. Why can we be sure that Jehovah will always do what is right?</b><br>
            What, though, if Jehovah had not provided a ransom but had set justice aside by allowing Adam’s imperfect sons and daughters to live forever? People would likely wonder if God might disregard justice in other matters as well. For example, might he fail to keep some of his promises? We need not worry about such a possibility. The fact that Jehovah carried out justice even at great cost to himself—sacrificing his own dear Son—assures us that he will always do what is right.<br><br>

            <b>6. What is one way that the ransom reveals Jehovah’s love? (1 John 4:9, 10)</b><br>
            While the ransom helps us to understand that Jehovah is just, it especially helps us to grasp the depth of his love. (John 3:16; read 1 John 4:9, 10.) The teaching of the ransom reveals that Jehovah wants us not only to have endless life but also to be part of his family. Consider: When Adam sinned, Jehovah expelled him from His family of worshippers. As a result, all of us have been born outside of God’s family. But on the basis of the ransom, Jehovah forgives our sins and will eventually bring into his family all mankind who exercise faith and who are obedient. Even now we can have a warm relationship with Jehovah and with our fellow worshippers. Truly, we are recipients of Jehovah’s tender love!—Rom. 5:10, 11.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>John 3:16: “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.”</i><br>
            <i>1 John 4:9, 10: “By this the love of God was revealed in our case, that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world so that we might gain life through him. The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.”</i><br>
            <i>Romans 5:10, 11: “For if when we were enemies we became reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more we will be saved by his life, now that we have become reconciled. Not only that, but we are also exulting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.”</i></div><br>

            <b>7. How does Jesus’ suffering help us understand how much Jehovah loves us?</b><br>
            We can better understand how much Jehovah loves us if we consider what the ransom cost him. Satan claims that no servant of God will remain loyal to Him when it is hard to do so. To refute that charge, Jehovah allowed Jesus to suffer before he died. (Job 2:1-5; 1 Pet. 2:21) As Jehovah looked on, Jesus was mocked by religious opposers, whipped raw by soldiers, and nailed to a stake. Then Jehovah watched as his dear Son was left to suffer a painful death. (Matt. 27:28-31, 39) Jehovah had the power to stop the process at any given point. For example, when opposers said: “Let [God] now rescue him if He wants him,” Jehovah could have done just that. (Matt. 27:42, 43) However, if God had stepped in, no ransom would have been paid and we would have been left without hope. So Jehovah permitted his Son to endure suffering until he drew his last breath.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Job 2:1-5: “Afterward it came to be the day when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and Satan also came among them to take his station before Jehovah. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where have you come from?’ Satan answered Jehovah: ‘From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.’ So Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Have you taken note of my servant Job, that there is no one like him on the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning away from bad? He is still holding fast to his integrity, even though you try to incite me against him to destroy him for no reason.’ But Satan answered Jehovah: ‘Skin for skin! A man will give everything that he has for his life. But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike his bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse you to your face.’”</i><br>
            <i>1 Peter 2:21: “In fact, to this course you were called, because even Christ suffered for you, leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely.”</i><br>
            <i>Matthew 27:28-31: “And they stripped him and put a scarlet cloak on him, and after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying: ‘Greetings, King of the Jews!’ And they spat on him and took the reed and began hitting him on his head. Finally, after they had mocked him, they stripped off the cloak and put his outer garments on him and led him off to be nailed to the stake.”</i><br>
            <i>Matthew 27:39: “So those passing by would speak abusively of him, wagging their heads.”</i><br>
            <i>Matthew 27:42, 43: “He saved others; he cannot save himself! He is King of Israel; let him come down off the torture stake now, and we will believe in him. He has put his trust in God; let Him now rescue him if He wants him, for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’”</i></div><br>

            <b>8. Did Jehovah feel pain when he saw his Son suffer? Explain.</b><br>
            Let us not think that because God is almighty, he does not have feelings! We are made in his image, created with the ability to feel, so it stands to reason that Jehovah has feelings. The Bible describes him as feeling “hurt” and “grieved.” (Ps. 78:40, 41) Consider, too, the experience of Abraham and Isaac. You will recall that Abraham was commanded to offer up his only son in sacrifice. (Gen. 22:9-12; Heb. 11:17-19) We can only imagine the range of emotions Abraham felt as he prepared to end Isaac’s life with a quick stroke of a knife. How much more grieved Jehovah must have felt as he observed his Son being cruelly tortured to death by ungodly men!<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Psalm 78:40, 41: “How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and made him feel hurt in the desert! Again and again they put God to the test, and they grieved the Holy One of Israel.”</i><br>
            <i>Genesis 22:9-12: “Finally they reached the place that the true God had indicated to him, and Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac hand and foot and put him on the altar on top of the wood. Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill his son. But Jehovah’s angel called to him from the heavens and said: ‘Abraham, Abraham!’ to which he answered: ‘Here I am!’ Then he said: ‘Do not harm the boy or do anything at all to him, for now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld your son, your only one, from me.’”</i><br>
            <i>Hebrews 11:17-19: “By faith Abraham, when he was tested, as good as offered up Isaac—the man who had gladly received the promises attempted to offer up his only-begotten son—although it had been said to him: ‘What will be called your offspring will be through Isaac.’ But he reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead, and he did receive him from there in an illustrative way.”</i></div><br>

            <b>9. What does Romans 8:32, 38, 39 help you to understand about the depth of Jehovah’s love for you and your fellow worshippers?</b><br>
            The ransom teaches us that no one loves us as much as Jehovah does—not even our dearest relative or best friend. (Read Romans 8:32, 38, 39.) No doubt Jehovah loves us more than we love ourselves. Do you want to live forever? Not as much as Jehovah wants you to. Do you want to have your sins forgiven? Not as much as Jehovah wants to forgive them. All he asks is that we accept his gracious gift by exercising faith and being obedient. The ransom is truly a profound expression of God’s love. And in the new world, we will learn even more about Jehovah’s love.—Eccl. 3:11.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Romans 8:32: “He who did not even spare his own Son but handed him over for us all, why will he not also with him kindly give us all other things?”</i><br>
            <i>Romans 8:38, 39: “For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God’s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</i><br>
            <i>Ecclesiastes 3:11: “He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has even put eternity in their heart; yet mankind will never find out the work that the true God has made from start to finish.”</i></div><br>

            <b>10. (a) What especially grieved Jesus about his execution? (b) In what ways did Jesus vindicate Jehovah’s name?</b><br>
            (a) Jesus cares deeply about his Father’s reputation. (John 14:31) Jesus was grieved that his being charged with blasphemy and sedition could bring reproach on his Father’s name. That is why he prayed: “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me.” (Matt. 26:39) (b) By keeping his integrity to Jehovah until death, Jesus ultimately vindicated the name of his Father. By remaining faithful under test, Jesus refuted the Devil’s claim that humans would not remain loyal to God when under trial. (Job 2:4, 5) Jesus also showed that Adam was to blame for his sin, not Jehovah. Jesus thus proved that perfect Adam could have been faithful if he had wanted to be and that there was nothing faulty in how Jehovah had created Adam.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>John 14:31: “But for the world to know that I love the Father, I am doing just as the Father has commanded me to do. Get up, let us go from here.”</i><br>
            <i>Matthew 26:39: “And going a little way forward, he fell on his face, praying: ‘My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.’”</i><br>
            <i>Job 2:4, 5: “But Satan answered Jehovah: ‘Skin for skin! A man will give everything that he has for his life. But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike his bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse you to your face.’”</i></div><br>

            <b>11. How did Jesus show deep love for people? (John 13:1)</b><br>
            The ransom also teaches us that Jesus cares deeply for people, especially for his disciples. (Prov. 8:31; read John 13:1.) For example, Jesus knew that some aspects of his earthly ministry would be very challenging, in particular his painful death. Yet, in carrying out his assignment on earth, he did not simply go through the motions. Instead, Jesus put his whole heart into preaching, teaching, and ministering to others. Even on the day of his death, Jesus took time to wash the feet of his apostles and give them many parting words of comfort and instruction. (John 13:12-15) Then while he was on the stake, Jesus took a few moments to give hope to a dying criminal and to arrange for his own mother’s care. (Luke 23:42, 43; John 19:26, 27) Thus Jesus’ deep love was expressed not only through his death but also through his entire life course on earth.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 8:31: “I was fond of the sons of men.”</i><br>
            <i>John 13:1: “Now because he knew before the festival of the Passover that his hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father, Jesus, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.”</i><br>
            <i>John 13:12-15: “When, now, he had washed their feet and had put his outer garments on, he again reclined at the table and said to them: ‘Do you understand what I have done to you? You address me as “Teacher” and “Lord,” and you are correct, for I am such. So if I, the Lord and Teacher, washed your feet, you also should wash the feet of one another. For I set the pattern for you, that just as I did to you, you should also do.’”</i><br>
            <i>Luke 23:42, 43: “And he went on to say: ‘Jesus, remember me when you get into your Kingdom.’ And he said to him: ‘Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in Paradise.’”</i><br>
            <i>John 19:26, 27: “So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by, he said to his mother: ‘Woman, see! Your son!’ Next he said to the disciple: ‘See! Your mother!’ And from that hour on, the disciple took her into his own home.”</i></div><br>

            <b>12. In what sense is Jesus continuing to make sacrifices in our behalf?</b><br>
            While Christ died “once for all time,” he is still making sacrifices for us. (Rom. 6:10) How so? He continues to expend time and effort as he puts the ransom benefits to work in our behalf. Consider what he is busy doing. He serves as our King, High Priest, and head of the congregation. (1 Cor. 15:25; Eph. 5:23; Heb. 2:17) He is in charge of the work of gathering the anointed and the great crowd, a task that will be completed before the great tribulation ends. (Matt. 25:32; Mark 13:27) He also sees to it that his faithful servants are well-fed spiritually during these last days. (Matt. 24:45) And throughout his Millennial Reign, he will continue to serve our interests. Jehovah truly gave his Son for us!<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Romans 6:10: “For the death that he died, he died with reference to sin once for all time, but the life that he lives, he lives with reference to God.”</i><br>
            <i>1 Corinthians 15:25: “For he must rule as king until God has put all enemies under his feet.”</i><br>
            <i>Ephesians 5:23: “Because a husband is head of his wife just as the Christ is head of the congregation, he being a savior of this body.”</i><br>
            <i>Hebrews 2:17: “Consequently, he had to become like his ‘brothers’ in all respects, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, in order to offer a propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of the people.”</i><br>
            <i>Matthew 25:32: “All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.”</i><br>
            <i>Mark 13:27: “And then he will send out the angels and will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from earth’s extremity to heaven’s extremity.”</i><br>
            <i>Matthew 24:45: “Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time?”</i></div><br>

            <b>13. How can meditation help you keep learning about the love that God and Christ have for us?</b><br>
            You can keep learning about the love that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus have for us if you continue to meditate on it. Perhaps during this year’s Memorial season, you can carefully read one or more of the Gospels. Do not try to cover too much material at one time. Instead, slow down and look for additional reasons why we should love Jehovah and Jesus. And by all means, share what you learn with others.<br><br>

            <b>14. In harmony with Psalm 119:97 and footnote, how can research help us keep learning about the ransom as well as other teachings?</b><br>
            If you have been in the truth for many years, you might wonder if it is possible to discover new insights on such familiar subjects as God’s justice, his love, and the ransom. The truth is that there is no end to what we can learn about these and other topics. So, what can you do? Take full advantage of the wealth of information that can be found in our publications. When you find a passage that you do not fully understand, do research. Then throughout the day, meditate on what you have discovered and what it tells you about Jehovah, his Son, and their love for you.—Read Psalm 119:97 and footnote.<br>

            <b>15. Why should we keep seeking Bible gems?</b><br>
            Do not be discouraged if you do not find something new or exciting every time you sit down to read or to do research. In a sense, you are like a person who pans for gold. Patiently, prospectors spend hours or days before finding even the smallest nugget of gold. Yet, they persist because every bit of gold is valuable to them. Of how much greater value is every gem of Bible truth! (Ps. 119:127; Prov. 8:10) So be patient and stick to your Bible reading schedule.—Ps. 1:2.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Psalm 119:127: “That is why I love your commandments more than gold, even refined gold.”</i><br>

            <b>16. How may we imitate Jehovah and Jesus?</b><br>
            As you study, look for ways to put what you learn into practice. For example, imitate Jehovah’s justice by treating others impartially. Imitate Jesus’ love for his Father and for others by being willing to suffer for Jehovah’s name and by expending yourself in behalf of your fellow Christians. Also, imitate Jesus by witnessing to others so that they too have the opportunity to accept Jehovah’s priceless gift.<br><br>

            <b>17. What will we consider in the next article?</b><br>
            The more we understand and appreciate the ransom, the more we will love Jehovah and his Son. In turn, they will respond with increased love for us. (John 14:21; Jas. 4:8) So let us use Jehovah’s provisions to keep learning about the ransom. The following article will consider some ways that we can benefit from the ransom and that we can respond appreciatively to Jehovah’s love.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>John 14:21: “Whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me. In turn, whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will clearly show myself to him.”</i><br>

            <b>WHAT DOES THE RANSOM TEACH YOU ABOUT . . .<br>
            Jehovah’s justice?</b><br>
            The ransom teaches us that Jehovah is perfectly just, as it took the sacrifice of one perfect man, Jesus, to balance the disobedience of Adam, ensuring justice is upheld. (Deut. 32:4; Rom. 5:19)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Deuteronomy 32:4: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness who is never unjust; righteous and upright is he.”</i><br>
            <i>Romans 5:19: “For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one person many will be made righteous.”</i></div><br>

            <b>WHAT DOES THE RANSOM TEACH YOU ABOUT . . .<br>
            Jehovah’s love?</b><br>
            The ransom reveals the depth of Jehovah’s love, as He sacrificed His Son to forgive our sins and bring us into His family, showing He loves us more than we love ourselves. (1 John 4:9, 10; Rom. 8:32)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>1 John 4:9, 10: “By this the love of God was revealed in our case, that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world so that we might gain life through him. The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.”</i><br>
            <i>Romans 8:32: “He who did not even spare his own Son but handed him over for us all, why will he not also with him kindly give us all other things?”</i></div><br>

            <b>WHAT DOES THE RANSOM TEACH YOU ABOUT . . .<br>
            Jesus’ love?</b><br>
            The ransom shows Jesus’ deep love for people, as he wholeheartedly ministered to others, comforted his disciples, and even cared for a criminal and his mother while dying. (John 13:1; Luke 23:42, 43)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>John 13:1: “Now because he knew before the festival of the Passover that his hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father, Jesus, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.”</i><br>

            How to use knowledge, understanding, and discernment to make wise decisions.<br><br>

            <b>1. What challenge do we all face?</b><br>
            Every day we need to make decisions. Some are relatively easy to make, such as what to have for breakfast or when to go to bed. Other matters are more difficult to decide. They may affect our health, our happiness, our loved ones, or our worship. We want our decisions to benefit us and our family. Above all, we hope that our decisions will please Jehovah.—Rom. 12:1, 2.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Romans 12:1, 2: “Therefore, I appeal to you by the compassions of God, brothers, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason. And stop being molded by this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, so that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”</i></div><br>

            <b>2. What steps will help you make wise decisions?</b><br>
            You are more likely to make a wise decision if you (1) get the facts, (2) consider Jehovah’s thinking on the matter, and (3) weigh the options. This article will discuss those steps, and it will also help us see how we can train our powers of discernment.—Prov. 2:11.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 2:11: “Then sound judgment will safeguard you, and discernment will protect you.”</i></div><br>

            <b>3. Illustrate why you need to get the facts before you make a decision.</b><br>
            The first step toward making a good decision is to get the facts. Why is this important? Imagine that a patient consults a doctor regarding a serious medical problem. Would the doctor make a decision about a course of treatment without first examining the patient or asking him questions? Certainly not. You too will make better decisions if you first consider the facts that have a bearing on the situation at hand. How can you do that?<br><br>

            <b>4. In harmony with Proverbs 18:13, how can you make sure that you know the facts?</b><br>
            You can often get the facts by asking questions. Suppose you are invited to a social gathering. Should you attend? If you are not acquainted with the host or the arrangements, you will need to ask him such questions as: “Where and when will the gathering be held? How large will it be? Who will supervise it? Who will attend? What activities are planned? Will alcoholic drinks be served?” The answers to these questions will help you to make a wise decision.—Read Proverbs 18:13.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 18:13: “When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, it is foolish and humiliating.”</i></div><br>

            <b>5. What should you do once you have the facts?</b><br>
            Next, facts in hand, look carefully at the full picture. For example, what if you learn that individuals who have no regard for Bible principles will attend the gathering or that alcoholic beverages will be served without supervision? Do you see the potential for this gathering to turn into a wild party? (1 Pet. 4:3) On the other hand, what if the timing of the gathering conflicts with your scheduled congregation meeting or field ministry? When you have seen the whole picture, you will be well on your way to making a good decision. But there is another step that you should take. You know how you see the situation; but how does Jehovah feel about it?—Prov. 2:6.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>1 Peter 4:3: “For the time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have done the will of the nations when you carried on in acts of brazen conduct, unbridled passions, overdrinking, wild parties, drinking bouts, and lawless idolatries.”</i><br>
            <i>Proverbs 2:6: “For Jehovah himself gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and discernment.”</i></div><br>

            <b>6. According to James 1:5, why should we pray for Jehovah’s help?</b><br>
            Ask Jehovah to help you understand his thinking. Jehovah promises to give us the wisdom to discern whether a certain path will please him. He gives such wisdom “generously to all and without reproaching.”—Read James 1:5.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>James 1:5: “So if any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God, for he gives generously to all and without reproaching, and it will be given him.”</i></div><br>

            <b>7. How can you acquire Jehovah’s thinking? Illustrate.</b><br>
            Once you have prayed for Jehovah’s direction, pay careful attention to his answer. To illustrate: If you got lost while traveling, you might ask a local resident for help. But would you then walk away before he had a chance to reply? Of course not. You would listen carefully to his directions. Similarly, after you ask Jehovah for wisdom, try to discern his answer by finding out which Bible laws and principles apply to your situation. For example, when deciding whether to attend the social gathering mentioned earlier, you might consider what the Bible says about wild parties, bad associations, and the need to put Kingdom interests ahead of your personal preferences.—Matt. 6:33; Rom. 13:13; 1 Cor. 15:33.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Matthew 6:33: “Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.”</i><br>
            <i>Romans 13:13: “Let us walk with decency as in the daytime, not in wild parties and drunkenness, not in immoral intercourse and brazen conduct, not in strife and jealousy.”</i><br>
            <i>1 Corinthians 15:33: “Do not be misled. Bad associations spoil useful habits.”</i></div><br>

            <b>8. What can you do if you need help to find the information you are looking for?</b><br>
            Still, at times you may need help to find the information you are looking for. You might get input from an experienced brother or sister. However, you will also benefit from doing your own research. There is a wealth of information in our study tools, such as the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses and Scriptures for Christian Living. Remember the goal: to make a decision that will please Jehovah.<br><br>

            <b>9. How can we be sure that our decision will please Jehovah? (Ephesians 5:17)</b><br>
            How can we be sure that our decision will please Jehovah? First of all, we need to get to know him well. “Knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding,” the Bible says. (Prov. 9:10) Yes, true understanding comes from knowing Jehovah’s qualities, his purpose, and what he loves or hates. Ask yourself, ‘Knowing what I do about Jehovah, what decision can I make that will please him?’—Read Ephesians 5:17.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 9:10: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.”</i><br>
            <i>Ephesians 5:17: “So keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord.”</i></div><br>

            <b>10. Why are Bible principles more important than family tradition or local culture?</b><br>
            In order to please Jehovah, we must at times disappoint those who are close to us. For example, some well-meaning parents may insist that their adult daughter marry a man who is financially well-off—or one who can pay them a large dowry—even though he is not spiritually strong. True, they want their daughter to be cared for materially, but who will help her to progress as a spiritual person? How does Jehovah view the matter? We find the answer at Matthew 6:33. There, Christians are urged to keep “seeking first the Kingdom.” Although we honor our parents and respect the people in our community, our main concern is to make Jehovah happy.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Matthew 6:33: “Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.”</i></div><br>

            <b>11. What quality discussed at Philippians 1:9, 10 will help you to weigh your options?</b><br>
            Once you have considered the Bible principles involved in your decision, you need to evaluate your options. (Read Philippians 1:9, 10; see study note on “full discernment.”) The quality of discernment will enable you to perceive the potential outcome of each option. Sometimes the decision can be easily made. But not all decisions are that straightforward. Discernment will help you to make wise decisions even in complex situations.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Philippians 1:9, 10: “And this is what I continue praying, that your love may abound still more and more with accurate knowledge and full discernment; that you may make sure of the more important things, so that you may be flawless and not stumbling others up to the day of Christ.”</i></div><br>

            <b>12-13. How can discernment help you make a wise decision regarding secular employment?</b><br>
            Consider this scenario. You are looking for a job to support your family. Two jobs are available. You review all the facts, taking note of the type of work, the schedule, the travel time, and so on. In both cases, the work itself is Scripturally acceptable. Perhaps you favor one option because you prefer the type of work or because the salary is higher. There are other factors, though, to consider before making a decision. For example, would either job conflict with your congregation meeting schedule? Would either job cut into the time you need to care for your family’s emotional and spiritual needs? Asking such questions will help you to put “the more important things”—your worship and your family’s needs—ahead of material advantages. Then you can reach a decision that Jehovah will bless.<br><br>

            <b>14. How will using discernment and showing love help us to avoid stumbling others?</b><br>
            Discernment also moves us to consider how our decision might affect other people so that we can avoid “stumbling others.” (Phil. 1:10) This is important when we make personal decisions in such areas as dress and grooming. For example, we may prefer a particular style of clothing or grooming. But what if others inside or outside the congregation would be offended by it? Discernment will help us to respect their feelings. Love will motivate us to seek the advantage of “the other person” and to be modest. (1 Cor. 10:23, 24, 32; 1 Tim. 2:9, 10) We will then make a decision that reflects our love and respect for others.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Philippians 1:10: “That you may make sure of the more important things, so that you may be flawless and not stumbling others up to the day of Christ.”</i><br>
            <i>1 Corinthians 10:23, 24: “All things are lawful, but not all things are advantageous. All things are lawful, but not all things build up. Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.”</i><br>
            <i>1 Corinthians 10:32: “Keep from becoming causes for stumbling to Jews as well as Greeks and to the congregation of God.”</i><br>
            <i>1 Timothy 2:9, 10: “Likewise, I desire the women to adorn themselves in well-arranged dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive clothing, but in the way that is proper for women professing devotion to God, namely, through good works.”</i></div><br>

            <b>15. What planning is needed before implementing a major decision?</b><br>
            If you are making a major decision, think about what it would take to implement it. Jesus taught us to “calculate the expense.” (Luke 14:28) So consider the amount of time, resources, and effort that you would need to invest to make the decision work. In some cases, you might consult your family to determine what each member would need to do to support the decision. Why is this kind of planning valuable? It may reveal that your decision needs some adjustments or that a different option is more practical. And when you involve your family members and listen to their input, they will more readily work with you to make the decision succeed.—Prov. 15:22.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Luke 14:28: “For example, who of you wanting to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it?”</i><br>
            <i>Proverbs 15:22: “Plans fail when there is no consultation, but there is accomplishment through many advisers.”</i></div><br>

            <b>16. What steps will help you to make a decision that will succeed?</b><br>
            If you have followed the steps outlined above, you are ready to make a wise decision. You have obtained the facts and examined the principles that will help you make a decision that is pleasing to Jehovah. Now you can ask Jehovah to help you make your decision succeed.<br><br>

            <b>17. What is the key to making good decisions?</b><br>
            Even if you have made many successful decisions in the past, remember that the key to making good decisions is to rely, not on your own intelligence or experience, but on the wisdom from Jehovah. He alone can give you true knowledge, understanding, and discernment—the building blocks of wisdom. (Prov. 2:1-5) Jehovah can help you to make decisions that please him.—Ps. 23:2, 3.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 2:1-5: “My son, if you accept my sayings and treasure up my commandments, by making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to discernment, if you call out for understanding and raise your voice for discernment, if you keep seeking for it as for silver, and you keep searching for it as for hidden treasures, then you will understand the fear of Jehovah, and you will find the knowledge of God.”</i><br>
            <i>Psalm 23:2, 3: “In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; he leads me to well-watered resting-places. He refreshes my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of his name.”</i></div><br>

            <b>WHAT DO THESE SCRIPTURES TEACH YOU ABOUT MAKING GOOD DECISIONS?<br>
            Proverbs 18:13</b><br>
            When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, it is foolish and humiliating. We should get the facts before making a decision.<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 18:13: “When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, it is foolish and humiliating.”</i></div><br>

            <b>1. What is one reason why Jehovah created the marriage arrangement?</b><br>
            Jehovah created marriage to bring joy, as He is the happy God and wants us to enjoy life through a close bond of love and respect. (Prov. 5:18)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Proverbs 5:18: “Let your water source be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth.”</i></div><br>

            <b>2. What is the state of many marriages today?</b><br>
            Many marriages today are unhappy because couples forget their wedding promises, with husbands often abusing their wives physically, verbally, or emotionally, or viewing pornography.<br><br>

            <b>3. What factors can contribute to a husband’s abusive behavior?</b><br>
            Factors include being raised by a violent father, cultural ideas that a man must use force, lack of emotional control, a warped view from pornography, and intensified issues from the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>

            <b>4. What do Christian husbands need to guard against, and why?</b><br>
            Christian husbands must guard against adopting improper views of women, as thoughts lead to actions, and worldly thinking can influence them to abuse their wives. (Rom. 12:2)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Romans 12:2: “Stop being molded by this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, so that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”</i></div><br>

            <b>5. According to 1 Peter 3:7, how should a husband treat his wife?</b><br>
            A husband should honor his wife, treating her with kindness and love, as honoring her respects Jehovah’s command. (1 Pet. 3:7)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>1 Peter 3:7: “You husbands, in the same way, continue dwelling with them according to knowledge. Assign them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since they are also heirs with you of the undeserved favor of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.”</i></div><br>

            <b>6. How does Jehovah feel about men who physically abuse their wife?</b><br>
            Jehovah hates violence and condemns husbands who abuse their wives, as it affects their relationship with Him, possibly hindering their prayers. (Col. 3:19)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Colossians 3:19: “You husbands, keep on loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them.”</i></div><br>

            <b>7. According to Ephesians 4:31, 32, what type of speech must husbands avoid?</b><br>
            Husbands must avoid angry, hurtful speech like screaming and abusive words, as Jehovah hates such speech and it damages their marriage and relationship with Him. (Eph. 4:31)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Ephesians 4:31: “Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from you along with all badness.”</i></div><br>

            <b>8. How does Jehovah feel about pornography, and why?</b><br>
            Jehovah hates pornography because it damages a husband’s relationship with Him and degrades his wife, as Jesus said a man who looks lustfully commits adultery in his heart. (Matt. 5:28)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Matthew 5:28: “But I say to you that everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”</i></div><br>

            <b>9. Why does Jehovah hate it when a husband is sexually demeaning toward his wife?</b><br>
            Jehovah hates sexually demeaning behavior because it’s cold and thoughtless, and He expects husbands to love, cherish, and respect their wife’s feelings. (Eph. 5:28)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Ephesians 5:28: “In this way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself.”</i></div><br>

            <b>10. How can husbands benefit from Jesus’ example?</b><br>
            Husbands can overcome abusive behavior by imitating Jesus, who treated his disciples with kindness and dignity, serving as a model for loving their wives. (Eph. 5:25)<br>
            <div class="scripture-indent"><i>Ephesians 5:25: “Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it.”</i></div><br>

            <b>11. How did Jesus treat his apostles?</b><br>
