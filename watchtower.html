                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(1st–2nd Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>Following the death of the apostles, false worship began to infiltrate Christianity, fulfilling the warning that “savage wolves” would emerge to distort the truth (Acts 20:29). Satan, described as “the father of the lie” (John 8:44), cunningly blended pagan practices with Christian teachings, obscuring the pure worship of Jehovah. This period marked a significant departure from the apostolic teachings, as false doctrines gained traction among early Christians.</p>
                        <p>Gnosticism, a prominent heresy, denied Jehovah’s sovereignty by promoting mystical and pagan beliefs, including Babylonian star worship, which directly contradicted the declaration that “Jehovah is the true God” (Jeremiah 10:10). Gnostic teachings, which emphasized secret knowledge and dualistic philosophies, led many astray from the simplicity of scriptural truth. Historical records, such as those from early Christian writers like Irenaeus, confirm Gnosticism’s widespread influence, with sects like the Valentinians adapting pagan myths into Christian frameworks, further muddying pure worship.</p>
                        <p>Ignatius of Antioch, who died around 110 CE, contributed to this apostasy by introducing a clergy-laity distinction, claiming bishops held superior authority. This defied Jesus’ teaching that “you are all brothers” (Matthew 23:8). Ignatius’ letters, preserved in collections like the *Ante-Nicene Fathers*, promoted unscriptural hierarchies reminiscent of Babylonian priestly systems, establishing a foundation for later ecclesiastical power structures. His teachings marked a significant shift from the egalitarian worship practiced by early Christians.</p>
                        <p>Amid this growing apostasy, Polycarp, a disciple of the apostle John, stood firm. He rejected pagan festivals like Saturnalia, which celebrated the Roman god Saturn and conflicted with Christian principles. Before his martyrdom in 155 CE, Polycarp boldly declared, “I am a Christian,” affirming his loyalty to Jehovah. His courage, documented in the *Martyrdom of Polycarp*, preserved the foundation of true worship, aligning with the promise that “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25). Archaeological evidence, such as early Christian inscriptions in Smyrna, supports the historical context of Polycarp’s stand against pagan influences.</p>
                        <h2>Faithful Stand</h2>
                        <p>Polycarp’s unwavering courage thwarted Satan’s schemes, ensuring that the spark of true worship remained alive. His example fulfilled the assurance that “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32), inspiring future generations to resist false teachings. His stand underscores the enduring power of Jehovah’s truth against overwhelming opposition.</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Nicene Corruption: Constantine’s Trinity</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(4th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Council of Nicaea in 325 CE represented the pinnacle of apostasy, as foretold in the description of “Babylon the Great” corrupting true worship (Revelation 17:5). Under Emperor Constantine, paganism was systematically merged with Christianity, obscuring Jehovah’s name and distorting core biblical teachings. This council marked a turning point, institutionalizing false doctrines that would dominate for centuries.</p>
                        <p>Constantine, who ruled from 272 to 337 CE, convened the Council of Nicaea to unify the Roman Empire’s religious factions. He adopted the Trinity doctrine, a concept rooted in Babylonian triadic deities, using the term “homoousios” to assert that Jesus was equal to God. This contradicted the clear scriptural statement, “I am Jehovah, there is no other” (Isaiah 45:5). Constantine’s Edict of Milan in 313 CE had already legitimized Christianity, but it also promoted pagan festivals like Christmas, which derived from the birthday of the sun god Mithra (Jeremiah 10:2). Historical records, such as Eusebius’ *Life of Constantine*, confirm Constantine’s blending of pagan and Christian practices to consolidate political power.</p>
                        <p>Arius, a presbyter from Alexandria (256–336 CE), boldly opposed the Trinity, upholding the scriptural truth that Jesus is “the firstborn of creation” (Colossians 1:15). His teachings, which emphasized Jehovah’s unique sovereignty, were condemned at Nicaea, leading to his exile. Despite facing the threat of death, Arius’ stand preserved a spark of truth, fulfilling the promise that “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). Surviving fragments of Arius’ writings, such as his letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia, corroborate his commitment to monotheism, aligning with biblical principles.</p>
                        <h2>Resisting Apostasy</h2>
                        <p>Arius’ courage ensured that Jehovah’s truth endured, countering Constantine’s decrees and preserving the declaration, “I am Jehovah, that is my name” (Isaiah 42:8). His resistance laid a foundation for later reformers to challenge the entrenched errors of the Trinity and pagan influences.</p>

                        <h2>(4th–5th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>As Catholic apostasy intensified, blending paganism with Christianity, the faithful scribe Jerome played a pivotal role in preserving Jehovah’s Word. His efforts countered the influence of “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5), ensuring that scripture remained accessible despite Satan’s attempts to obscure it. Jerome’s work fulfilled the assurance that “the word of God is not bound” (2 Timothy 2:9).</p>
                        <p>Commissioned by Pope Damasus, Jerome completed the Latin Vulgate translation by 405 CE, relying on Hebrew and Greek manuscripts that included the divine name “YHWH.” Unlike the Trinitarian errors promoted at Nicaea, Jerome’s meticulous scholarship preserved the integrity of the scriptures. He consulted original texts, such as the Hebrew Masoretic manuscripts, to retain Jehovah’s name and uphold biblical laws. The Vulgate, preserved in institutions like the Bodleian Library in Oxford, became a vital resource for scholars, enabling future restorers of pure worship. This aligns with the promise that “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8). Archaeological discoveries, such as the Codex Sinaiticus, confirm the accuracy of early manuscripts used by Jerome, supporting his commitment to scriptural fidelity.</p>
                        <h2>Enduring Truth</h2>
                        <p>Though later misused by a corrupt church, Jerome’s Vulgate safeguarded Jehovah’s Word, complementing subsequent efforts to restore pure worship. His translation ensured that the scriptures remained a beacon of truth, as Jesus declared, “My words will not pass away” (Matthew 24:35).</p>

                        <h2>(12th–13th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Waldensians, led by Peter Waldo, courageously battled Catholic suppression to preserve Jehovah’s Word, fulfilling the prophecy that “the dragon was enraged” with those upholding truth (Revelation 12:17). Their efforts to make scripture accessible to the common people challenged the Catholic Church’s monopoly on religious knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Defying Catholic bans on vernacular translations, the Waldensians produced Bible translations in languages like Provençal, making God’s Word available to the poor. Branded as heretics, they hid manuscripts in the Alps to protect them from destruction. Their work countered papal indulgences and pagan rituals, such as the veneration of relics, which lacked scriptural basis. By sharing truth with humility, the Waldensians fulfilled the command to “worship with spirit and truth” (John 4:24). Historical accounts, such as those in the *Cambridge Medieval History*, document their widespread influence, with Waldensian communities persisting despite brutal persecution.</p>
                        <h2>Preserving Truth</h2>
                        <p>The Waldensians’ sacrifices ensured the survival of Jehovah’s Word, laying critical groundwork for the Reformation. Their efforts reflect the enduring promise that “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8), guiding future generations toward pure worship.</p>

                        <h2>(14th–16th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>During the Reformation, courageous translators like John Wycliffe, Jan Hus, and William Tyndale risked their lives to restore access to Jehovah’s Word, breaking the chains of Catholic suppression. Their efforts fulfilled the prophecy that “those in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another” (Malachi 3:16), spreading truth despite fierce opposition.</p>
                        <p>John Wycliffe (1328–1384) produced the first complete English Bible in 1382, translated from Jerome’s Vulgate, defying Catholic bans on vernacular scriptures. Declared a heretic, his bones were exhumed and burned posthumously, yet his translations inspired widespread reform. Wycliffe’s work, preserved in manuscripts like the Wycliffe Bible at Oxford, aligned with the declaration that “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p>Jan Hus (1369–1415), a Bohemian reformer, rejected unscriptural practices like indulgences, preaching the Bible’s authority. Burned at the stake in 1415, his writings influenced Martin Luther and the broader Reformation. Hus’ trial records, archived in Prague, confirm his unwavering commitment to scriptural truth, fulfilling the promise that “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p>
                        <p>William Tyndale (1494–1536) advanced the cause by translating the Pentateuch and using “Jehovah” in texts like Exodus 6:3, defying Catholic prohibitions. Strangled and burned in 1536, Tyndale’s translations shaped the King James Version, spreading Jehovah’s name as urged in “declare his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24). Surviving copies of Tyndale’s New Testament, such as those in the British Library, attest to his meticulous scholarship.</p>

                        <h2>(17th–19th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>Before the emergence of the Bible Students, individuals like Henry Ainsworth, Henry Grew, and George Storrs rejected false doctrines, laying essential groundwork for the restoration of pure worship. Their efforts fulfilled the promise that “Jehovah searches for those loyal to him” (2 Chronicles 16:9), clearing the way for truth to prevail.</p>
                        <p>Henry Ainsworth (1571–1622), a Puritan scholar, used “Jehovah” in his 1612 annotations on the Psalms, notably Psalm 83:18, countering Trinitarian errors. Exiled for his beliefs, his work, preserved in rare books like those at the University of Amsterdam, promoted the proclamation of God’s name, as urged in “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1).</p>
                        <p>Henry Grew (1781–1862) rejected the Trinity and the hellfire doctrine, teaching the importance of Jehovah’s name. His pamphlets, which circulated widely in the 19th century, influenced Charles Taze Russell and aligned with the scriptural truth that “the dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5). Grew’s writings, archived in theological libraries, reflect his commitment to biblical accuracy.</p>
                        <p>George Storrs (1796–1879) taught the hope of an earthly resurrection in his *Six Sermons*, rejecting the immortal soul doctrine. His teachings, which reached thousands through publications, aligned with the promise that “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11). Storrs’ influence is documented in 19th-century religious journals, highlighting his role in restoring scriptural hope.</p>

                        <p>Charles Taze Russell spearheaded a pivotal movement to restore pure worship, rejecting the false doctrines of mainstream religion. His work fulfilled the prophecy that “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14), laying a foundation for the modern restoration of Jehovah’s truth.</p>
                        <p>Influenced by Henry Grew and George Storrs, Russell rejected the Trinity, hellfire, and immortal soul doctrines. In 1870, he formed a Bible study group in Pittsburgh, which grew into a global movement. Launching *Zion’s Watch Tower* in 1879 and founding the Watch Tower Society in 1884, Russell calculated 1914 as the year of Christ’s enthronement, based on Daniel 4:25. This prediction was strikingly confirmed by the outbreak of World War I, aligning with signs of “nation against nation” (Matthew 24:7). Despite persecution, Russell’s efforts restored scriptural truth, fulfilling Jehovah’s call, “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10). Historical records, such as early Watch Tower publications preserved in the Watchtower Archives, document Russell’s extensive preaching campaigns, which reached millions.</p>
                        <h2>Restoring Truth</h2>
                        <p>Russell’s foundational work established the Bible Students, later known as Jehovah’s Witnesses, as a beacon of truth, countering centuries of apostasy and advancing the global preaching of God’s Kingdom.</p>

                        <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses have fully restored pure worship, preaching God’s Kingdom message worldwide, fulfilling the prophecy that “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). Through courageous leadership and unwavering dedication, they have overcome opposition to spread scriptural truth.</p>
                        <p>Joseph Franklin Rutherford (1869–1942), succeeding Russell in 1917, faced intense persecution, including imprisonment in 1918 for publishing biblical truth. His legal victories, including 43 Supreme Court cases, secured the right to preach, as documented in U.S. legal archives. In 1931, Rutherford named the group Jehovah’s Witnesses, based on Isaiah 43:10, and utilized radio broadcasts to “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1), reaching millions globally.</p>
                        <p>Nathan H. Knorr (1905–1977), leading from 1942, oversaw the release of the New World Translation (1950–1961), which restored Jehovahwich restored Jehovah’s name and corrected apostate substitutions like “Lord.” By founding the Gilead School in 1943, Knorr trained missionaries who spread truth to 240 lands, fulfilling the declaration that “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). The translation’s accuracy is supported by comparisons with ancient manuscripts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, which confirm the frequent use of “YHWH” in Hebrew texts.</p>
                        <p>Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses, numbering approximately 9 million, have logged 1.5 billion hours preaching in 2024, despite bans, such as Russia’s 2017 prohibition, which was condemned by international human rights organizations. Their global mission upholds Jehovah’s truth, as promised in “Jehovah loves those who love him” (Psalm 31:23). Statistical reports from the 2024 Service Year confirm their extensive outreach, with a peak membership of around 9 million and 7.5 million Bible studies conducted, demonstrating the fulfillment of the global preaching work.</p>         
                        <h2>Pure Worship Restored</h2>
                        <p>Through the tireless efforts of Rutherford, Knorr, and millions of Witnesses, pure worship has been fully restored, ensuring that Jehovah’s name and truth shine brightly across the earth.</p>
