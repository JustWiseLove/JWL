                        <h2>(1st–2nd Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>Following the death of the apostles by the late first century CE, false worship infiltrated the Christian congregation, as Paul warned, “Savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock” (Acts 20:29). Satan, “the father of the lie” (John 8:44), orchestrated this apostasy, blending paganism with truth, for “the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers” (2 Corinthians 4:4). By the second century, figures like Ignatius of Antioch (died c. 110 CE) introduced a clergy-laity divide, contradicting Jesus’ teaching, “You are all brothers” (Matthew 23:8). Gnosticism, with its mystical dualism, denied Jehovah’s sovereignty, echoing ancient Babylonian star worship (2000 BCE). The Didache (c. 100 CE), a corrupted manual, added unscriptural rituals, defying “worship with spirit and truth” (John 4:24). Historical records document this drift toward Greek philosophy, obscuring Jehovah’s name, as “they exchanged the truth of God for the lie” (Romans 1:25).</p>
                        <p>Despite this, Jehovah’s Word endured, as “not one word of all his good promise failed” (1 Kings 8:56). Faithful Christians, like Polycarp (died c. 155 CE), resisted, refusing to honor Caesar, mirroring Daniel’s stand (Daniel 6:10). Roman persecution under Nero (64 CE), where Christians were “torn apart by dogs” (Tacitus, Annals), tested their faith, yet they rejoiced, “counted worthy to be dishonored” (Acts 5:41). The Septuagint (200 BCE), preserving “YHWH,” safeguarded Jehovah’s name, fulfilling “the word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25). This apostasy set the stage for further corruption, but Jehovah promised, “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <h2>Roots of Apostasy</h2>
                        <p>False teachers like Marcion (c. 140 CE) rejected the Hebrew Scriptures, distorting Jesus’ role, contrary to “the faithful and true witness” (Revelation 3:14). Pagan festivals, such as Saturnalia (217 BCE), infiltrated, laying the groundwork for Christmas. Jehovah’s judgment loomed, as “he will render to each one according to his works” (Romans 2:6). Faithful scribes preserved manuscripts, like Codex Sinaiticus (350 CE), ensuring “the word of God is alive” (Hebrews 4:12).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">False Worship at Nicaea</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(325 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Council of Nicaea in 325 CE, convened by Emperor Constantine, entrenched false worship by adopting the Trinity doctrine, a pagan concept rooted in Babylonian triads (2000 BCE), not Scripture. Jehovah declares, “I am Jehovah, and there is no other; there is no God except me” (Isaiah 45:5), yet Nicaea claimed Jesus was “co-equal” with God, contradicting “The Father is greater than I am” (John 14:28). Historical records reveal Constantine’s aim to merge Christianity with paganism, using terms like “homoousios” (same substance), alien to “the truth of God” (Romans 1:25). The Tetragrammaton, preserved in the Dead Sea Scrolls (200 BCE), was further replaced with “Lord,” defying “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15).</p>
                        <p>Faithful ones, like Arius (died 336 CE), upheld Jesus as “the firstborn of all creation” (Colossians 1:15) but were exiled. Constantine’s adoption of Mithra’s birthday (December 25) birthed Christmas, condemned by “Do not learn the way of the nations” (Jeremiah 10:2). Jehovah’s Word survived in manuscripts like Codex Vaticanus (350 CE), as “my words will by no means pass away” (Matthew 24:35). Nicaea’s lies spread, but Jehovah promised, “The truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p>
                        <h2>Legacy of Nicaea</h2>
                        <p>Nicaea solidified “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5), with clergy hierarchies mimicking Rome’s priesthoods, defying “Do not call anyone your father on earth” (Matthew 23:9). Persecution of dissenters, like the Donatists, echoed Pharaoh’s oppression (Exodus 1:11). Yet, Jehovah’s truth persisted, as “he searches the hearts of all” (1 Chronicles 28:9), preparing for restoration, “I will purify the lips of the peoples” (Zephaniah 3:9).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I am Jehovah, and there is no other.” —Isaiah 45:5</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(4th–16th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Word, “sharper than any two-edged sword” (Hebrews 4:12), survived relentless attacks, fulfilling “The word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8). From the fourth century, the Catholic Church restricted Bible access, burning translations and executing readers, as “the dragon was enraged” (Revelation 12:17). Faithful men risked death to preserve it. Jerome (347–420 CE), though tainted by Nicaea’s errors, produced the Latin Vulgate (405 CE), preserving Hebrew and Greek texts. The Codex Alexandrinus (450 CE), containing “YHWH,” survived, proving Jehovah’s protection, “My word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11).</p>
                        <p>The Waldensians (12th century) translated Scripture into vernacular, defying papal bans, as “the word of God is not bound” (2 Timothy 2:9). John Wycliffe (1320–1384), “the morning star of the Reformation,” translated the Bible into English (1382), declaring Jehovah’s truth, “You will know the truth” (John 8:32). Burned posthumously, his work endured, as historical records confirm. William Tyndale (1494–1536) translated directly from Hebrew and Greek, restoring “Jehovah” in Exodus 6:3, defying “Do not add to his words” (Proverbs 30:6). Strangled and burned in 1536, Tyndale’s work shaped the King James Version, fulfilling Psalm 119:105, “Your word is a lamp to my foot.” Jan Hus (1372–1415), burned for preaching Wycliffe’s truths, and Lefèvre d’Étaples (1455–1536), exiled for French translations, suffered as “those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Archaeological finds, like the Cairo Geniza (9th century) with “YHWH,” confirm their efforts.</p>
                        <h2>Martyrs for Truth</h2>
                        <p>The Catholic Church’s Index of Forbidden Books (1559) banned vernacular Bibles, but Jehovah ensured survival, as “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17). Scientific analysis, like radiocarbon dating of Codex Sinaiticus (350 CE), confirms manuscript antiquity, aligning with “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25). These martyrs’ sacrifices paved the way for “the restoration of all things” (Acts 3:21).</p>

                        <h2>(17th–19th Century)</h2>
                        <p>Before the Bible Students, faithful men rejected false doctrines and restored Jehovah’s name, fulfilling “Those in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another” (Malachi 3:16). Henry Ainsworth (1571–1622) used “Jehovah” in his Psalms annotations (1612), citing Psalm 83:18, “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High.” Historical records confirm his influence on Puritans seeking pure worship, as “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). Henry Grew (1781–1862), a Baptist preacher, rejected the Trinity and hellfire, teaching Jehovah’s name, influencing Charles Taze Russell, fulfilling “I will give you shepherds” (Jeremiah 3:15).</p>
                        <p>George Storrs (1796–1879), via <em>Bible Examiner</em>, taught earthly resurrection (John 5:28-29) and rejected immortal souls, as “the dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5), impacting Russell. Joseph Wolff (1795–1862), a missionary, used “Jehovah” in Asian translations, defying apostate bans, as “declare his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24). The Aleppo Codex (930 CE), with “YHWH,” supported their work, proving “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25). Facing exile and scorn, they stood firm, as “he knows how to deliver people of godly devotion” (2 Peter 2:9).</p>
                        <h2>Preparing the Way</h2>
                        <p>These men countered Satan’s obscuring of Jehovah’s name, as “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19). Their writings, preserved in archives like the British Museum, align with the Lachish Letters (590 BCE), mentioning “YHWH.” By rejecting paganism, like Christmas from Mithra worship (200 BCE), they prepared for “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14), fulfilling “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(Late 19th Century)</h2>
                        <p>In the 1870s, Charles Taze Russell founded the Bible Students in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to restore true worship, fulfilling “I will purify the lips of the peoples” (Zephaniah 3:9). Rejecting Christendom’s pagan doctrines—Trinity, hellfire, and immortal souls—they studied Scripture diligently, as “the word of God is alive” (Hebrews 4:12). In 1879, they launched <em>Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence</em>, proclaiming Jehovah’s Kingdom, obeying “This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth” (Matthew 24:14). Historical archives, like <em>Food for Thinking Christians</em> (1881), highlight their focus on the earthly hope, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29). In 1884, they formed the Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society, relocating to Brooklyn, New York, by 1909 to expand their reach.</p>
                        <p>The year 1914, calculated from Daniel’s “seven times” (Daniel 4:25)—2,520 years from Jerusalem’s fall in 607 BCE, confirmed by the Nabonidus Chronicle (550 BCE)—marked Christ’s enthronement, as “the Son of man came on the clouds of heaven” (Matthew 24:30). World War I’s outbreak, killing 16 million, fulfilled “Nation will rise against nation” (Matthew 24:7), signaling the “last days” (2 Timothy 3:1). Russell faced slander, but his <em>Studies in the Scriptures</em> clarified the ransom (1 Timothy 2:6). Persecution, like the 1918 imprisonment of leaders under Joseph F. Rutherford, mirrored “You will be hated by all the nations” (Matthew 24:9). Released in 1919, they pressed on, as “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17). The Bible Students’ work laid the foundation for their renaming as Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1931, fulfilling “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10).</p>
                        <h2>Restoring Pure Worship</h2>
                        <p>The Bible Students rejected pagan practices, like Easter from the goddess Eostre (8th century CE), restoring first-century purity, as “worship with spirit and truth” (John 4:24). Their global tracts, distributed in millions, fulfilled “Declare his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24). Archaeological evidence, like Babylonian tablets, anchors the 607 BCE timeline, proving Jehovah’s guidance, “I am God, declaring the end from the beginning” (Isaiah 46:10). Their efforts prepared “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This good news of the Kingdom will be preached.” —Matthew 24:14</p>

                        <h2>(20th Century–Present)</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses, named in 1931, proclaim Jehovah’s Kingdom, “the stone” that will “crush all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). Jesus’ command, “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19), drives their preaching in 240 lands, with materials in over 1,000 languages, as historical records confirm. Their door-to-door ministry, formalized in the 1920s by the Bible Students, follows “teaching from house to house” (Acts 20:20). This urgent work fulfills “Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved” (Romans 10:13). Scientific evidence, like the 1918 Spanish Flu (50 million deaths) and rising CO2 levels since 1914, aligns with “pangs of distress” (Matthew 24:8), urging haste, as “the great day of Jehovah is near” (Zephaniah 1:14).</p>
                        <p>Their neutrality, refusing politics or war, reflects “My Kingdom is no part of this world” (John 18:36). In Nazi Germany, 10,000 Witnesses were imprisoned, 2,500 killed, as documented, yet they endured, as “Jehovah is my helper” (Hebrews 13:6). Today, 8.7 million Witnesses conduct 1.4 billion hours of preaching annually, fulfilling “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). Their disaster relief, like post-2010 Haiti aid, shows “love your neighbor” (Matthew 22:39), proving “the word of Jehovah speeds on” (2 Thessalonians 3:1).</p>
                        <h2>Global Unity</h2>
                        <p>With 120,000 congregations, Witnesses unite as “one flock” (John 10:16). Their website, the most translated globally, reaches billions, as “declare his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24). Despite bans, like Russia’s since 2017, they remain steadfast, as “the faithful one will keep them” (Psalm 31:23). Psychological studies (2020, <em>Psychology Today</em>) confirm faith-based resilience, aligning with “Happy is the man who keeps on enduring” (James 1:12).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Go, therefore, and make disciples.” —Matthew 28:19</p>

                        <h2>(20th Century)</h2>
                        <p>The <em>New World Translation</em> (NWT), released from 1950 to 1961, revised in 2013, restores Jehovah’s Word, fulfilling “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). Unlike the King James Version, which replaces “Jehovah” with “LORD” 6,800 times, the NWT uses “Jehovah” 7,237 times, based on the Dead Sea Scrolls (200 BCE) and Leningrad Codex (1008 CE). Its rendering of John 1:1, “The Word was a god,” rejects the Trinity, as “The Father is greater than I am” (John 14:28). Linguistic scholar Jason BeDuhn (<em>Truth in Translation</em>) praises its accuracy, calling it “one of the most unbiased.” Over 240 million copies have been printed, ensuring “the word of God is alive” (Hebrews 4:12).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s efforts to obscure Jehovah’s name, as “he has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), failed, as the NWT counters apostate translations. The Silver Scrolls (600 BCE), with “Jehovah,” confirm its antiquity. The NWT’s clarity, like Psalm 83:18, “You, whose name is Jehovah,” aids preaching, fulfilling “My word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11). Its digital reach, in 200 languages, spreads “the knowledge of Jehovah” (Habakkuk 2:14).</p>
                        <h2>Transforming Lives</h2>
                        <p>The NWT’s study aids clarify prophecies, “‘The stone’ will crush all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). Its rejection of hellfire, as “the dead know nothing” (Ecclesiastes 9:5), frees millions from fear, fulfilling “The truth will set you free” (John 8:32). In 2025, 20 million Bible studies use it, preparing people for “the new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), as “the upright will reside in the earth” (Proverbs 2:21).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This is my name forever.” —Exodus 3:15</p>

                        <p>In 1931, the Bible Students, under Joseph F. Rutherford, adopted the name “Jehovah’s Witnesses,” fulfilling Isaiah 43:10, “You are my witnesses,” says Jehovah. This divine designation marked them as “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14), distinct from false religion, “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5). Rutherford (1869–1942) led boldly, winning 43 U.S. Supreme Court cases to secure preaching rights, fulfilling “Righteousness exalts a nation” (Proverbs 14:34). Nathan H. Knorr (1905–1977) oversaw the NWT and founded Gilead School (1943), sending missionaries to “all the inhabited earth” (Matthew 24:14). The Governing Body, since 1971, directs globally, as “the apostles and elders” did (Acts 15:2).</p>
                        <p>Despite persecution, like Russia’s 2017 ban with over 2,000 arrests, they endure, as “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17). Their hope, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29), drives 8.7 million Witnesses to preach, fulfilling “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). Scientific evidence, like earth’s design for life (Isaiah 45:18), supports their paradise hope. Their unity across 120,000 congregations counters Satan’s lie, “the whole world is lying in his power” (1 John 5:19), proving “Your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom” (Psalm 145:13).</p>
                        <h2>Future Paradise</h2>
                        <p>Witnesses prepare for paradise, where “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24). Their 2019 convention, “Love Never Fails,” united millions, as “they will come from east and west” (Matthew 8:11). Unlike Christendom’s vague heaven, their hope is earthly, as “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5). Jehovah’s past acts, like Noah’s preservation (Genesis 7:23), assure “he knows how to deliver people of godly devotion” (2 Peter 2:9), fulfilling “Behold, I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You are my witnesses,” says Jehovah. —Isaiah 43:10</p>
