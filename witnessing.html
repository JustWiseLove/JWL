                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(Pre-Flood Era)</h2>
                        <p>From the dawn of humanity, faithful individuals bore witness to Jehovah’s righteousness, setting a pattern for pure worship despite opposition, as “the righteous will be remembered forever” (Psalm 112:6).</p>
                        <p><strong>Abel (c. 4000 BCE):</strong> Abel, Adam’s son, offered a sacrifice pleasing to Jehovah, testifying to faith through action (Genesis 4:4). Biblical accounts describe his offering as “by faith,” earning Jehovah’s approval (Hebrews 11:4). Though murdered by Cain, Abel’s witness endures, as his blood “cries out” (Genesis 4:10), foreshadowing faithful martyrs. His stand in a corrupt world mirrors the Moabite Stone’s evidence of Jehovah’s worship (vindicate.html, Item 3).</p>
                        <p><strong>Enoch (c. 3400 BCE):</strong> Enoch “walked with God,” boldly prophesying against wickedness (Jude 14-15). His preaching, recorded in biblical texts, warned of divine judgment, and Jehovah “took him” to spare him death (Genesis 5:24; Hebrews 11:5). Enoch’s courage in a violent era parallels modern door-to-door witnessing, as “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1).</p>
                        <p><strong>Noah (c. 3000 BCE):</strong> Noah, a “preacher of righteousness” (2 Peter 2:5), built the ark and warned of the Flood for 120 years (Genesis 6:3). Facing ridicule, he upheld Jehovah’s standards, saving his family (Hebrews 11:7). His witness, preserved in ancient Near Eastern flood accounts, aligns with artifacts like the Lachish Letters mentioning “YHWH” (vindicate.html, Item 3).</p>
                        <h3>Lessons for Witnessing</h3>
                        <p>Abel’s faith, Enoch’s boldness, and Noah’s endurance teach that witnessing requires trust in Jehovah, even amid hostility. Families can discuss: How can we show faith like Abel in daily choices? What bold actions mirror Enoch’s preaching?</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain.” — Hebrews 11:4</p>

                        <h2>(15th–6th Century BCE)</h2>
                        <p>Israel’s prophets boldly witnessed for Jehovah, declaring His name and laws despite idolatry, as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <p><strong>Moses (c. 1513–1407 BCE):</strong> Moses, raised in Egypt, led Israel from slavery, receiving the Law at Sinai, which declared “Jehovah your God is one Jehovah” (Deuteronomy 6:4). He proclaimed Jehovah’s name to Pharaoh (Exodus 3:15) and taught Israel to worship Him alone (Exodus 20:3). Facing rebellion, Moses interceded for Israel (Numbers 14:13-19), as biblical accounts record. The Silver Scrolls (vindicate.html, Item 3) confirm “YHWH” in his era.</p>
                        <p><strong>Samuel (c. 1100 BCE):</strong> As prophet and judge, Samuel anointed Saul and David, calling Israel to reject Baal worship (1 Samuel 12:10-20). His fearless preaching, preserved in Hebrew texts, restored true worship, as “proclaim his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24). Artifacts like the Arad Ostraca (vindicate.html, Item 3) show “YHWH” in his time.</p>
                        <p><strong>Jeremiah (c. 647–587 BCE):</strong> Jeremiah warned Judah of Babylon’s judgment, urging repentance (Jeremiah 7:2-7). Imprisoned and mocked, he proclaimed “Jehovah is the true God” (Jeremiah 10:10). His scrolls, burned by King Jehoiakim, were rewritten (Jeremiah 36:32), mirroring the Lachish Letters’ “YHWH” references (vindicate.html, Item 3).</p>
                        <h3>Lessons for Witnessing</h3>
                        <p>Moses’ leadership, Samuel’s zeal, and Jeremiah’s perseverance show witnessing requires courage and fidelity. Discuss: How can we boldly share Jehovah’s truth like Jeremiah, even when opposed?</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(1st Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>Jesus and His apostles established the model for Christian witnessing, proclaiming Jehovah’s Kingdom despite persecution, as “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p>
                        <p><strong>Jesus Christ (c. 2 BCE–33 CE):</strong> Jesus declared “I have made your name known” (John 17:26), teaching Jehovah’s purpose through parables and miracles (Matthew 4:17). He preached publicly and house-to-house (Luke 8:1), facing death on a stake to vindicate Jehovah’s sovereignty (Philippians 2:8). Biblical accounts and the Dead Sea Scrolls (vindicate.html, Item 4) confirm “YHWH” in His era.</p>
                        <p><strong>Peter (d. c. 64 CE):</strong> Peter, a leading apostle, boldly preached at Pentecost, declaring Jehovah’s resurrection of Jesus (Acts 2:32-36). Imprisoned and beaten, he continued witnessing (Acts 5:42), as “we must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29). His epistles, preserved in early manuscripts, urge faithfulness.</p>
                        <p><strong>Paul (d. c. 65 CE):</strong> Converted from persecutor to apostle, Paul traveled thousands of miles, establishing congregations and writing 14 epistles (Acts 9:15). Beheaded under Nero, his letters, in codices like Vaticanus (vindicate.html, Item 5), proclaim “Jehovah is my helper” (Hebrews 13:6).</p>
                        <h3>Lessons for Witnessing</h3>
                        <p>Jesus’ example, Peter’s boldness, and Paul’s endurance inspire modern preaching. Discuss: How can we imitate Jesus’ house-to-house ministry in our community?</p>

                        <h2>(1st–4th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>Early Christians faced Roman persecution but witnessed boldly, preserving Jehovah’s truth, as “be faithful even to death” (Revelation 2:10).</p>
                        <p><strong>Polycarp of Smyrna (69–155 CE):</strong> A disciple of John, Polycarp refused to worship Caesar, declaring, “I am a Christian.” Burned at the stake, his martyrdom, recorded in early Christian texts, upheld Jehovah’s worship, as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25). The Septuagint’s “YHWH” (vindicate.html, Item 4) supported his faith.</p>
                        <p><strong>Justin Martyr (100–165 CE):</strong> A philosopher-turned-Christian, Justin wrote *Apologies* defending Christianity, proclaiming Jehovah as the true God. Beheaded under Marcus Aurelius, his works, in historical archives, resisted paganism, as “proclaim his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24). Codex Sinaiticus (vindicate.html, Item 5) preserved his era’s scriptures.</p>
                        <p><strong>Other Martyrs:</strong> Thousands, like Perpetua (d. 203 CE), faced arenas, testifying to Jehovah’s Kingdom. Their courage, documented in Roman records, inspired later witnesses.</p>
                        <h3>Lessons for Witnessing</h3>
                        <p>Polycarp and Justin’s sacrifices show witnessing may cost everything. Discuss: How can we stand firm like Polycarp in a world that opposes truth?</p>

                        <p>Medieval and Reformation translators risked death to make Jehovah’s Word accessible, restoring His name, as “those in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another” (Malachi 3:16).</p>
                        <p><strong>Waldensians (12th Century):</strong> Led by Peter Waldo, the Waldensians translated vernacular Bibles, defying Catholic bans. Persecuted as heretics, they hid manuscripts in the Alps, as historical records show. Their work, echoing “worship with spirit and truth” (John 4:24), reached the poor, supported by the Cairo Geniza’s “YHWH” (vindicate.html, Item 6).</p>
                        <p><strong>John Wycliffe (1328–1384):</strong> Wycliffe’s English Bible (1382) from the Vulgate broke Catholic control. Declared a heretic, his bones were burned, but his translations, in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, spread truth, as “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <p><strong>Jan Hus (1369–1415):</strong> Hus preached Bible truth, rejecting indulgences. Burned in 1415, his writings, in historical archives, influenced Luther, as “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p>
                        <p><strong>William Tyndale (1494–1536):</strong> Tyndale’s Pentateuch (1530) used “Jehovah” (Exodus 6:3). Strangled and burned, his translations, in the British Library, London, shaped the King James Version, supported by the Aleppo Codex (vindicate.html, Item 6).</p>
                        <h3>Lessons for Witnessing</h3>
                        <p>Their sacrifices teach that witnessing involves sharing truth at all costs. Discuss: How can we make Jehovah’s Word accessible like Tyndale today?</p>

                        <p>Before modern Witnesses, individuals rejected apostate doctrines, paving the way for pure worship, as “Jehovah searches for those loyal to him” (2 Chronicles 16:9).</p>
                        <p><strong>Henry Ainsworth (1571–1622):</strong> A Puritan, Ainsworth used “Jehovah” in Psalms annotations (1612), citing Psalm 83:18. Exiled, his work, in the British Library, London, influenced Puritans, as “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1). The King James Version’s “Jehovah” (vindicate.html, Item 7) reflects his era.</p>
                        <p><strong>Henry Grew (1781–1862):</strong> Grew rejected Trinity and hellfire, teaching “Jehovah” as God’s name. His pamphlets, in historical archives, shaped Russell, as “the dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5). His witness countered false religion, like the Leningrad Codex’s “YHWH” (vindicate.html, Item 6).</p>
                        <p><strong>George Storrs (1796–1879):</strong> Storrs taught earthly resurrection and no immortal soul via *Six Sermons*. Persecuted, his writings, in the British Museum, London, inspired Bible Students, as “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11).</p>

                        <p>Charles Taze Russell restored pure worship through systematic preaching, as “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p><strong>Charles Taze Russell (1852–1916):</strong> Influenced by Grew and Storrs, Russell rejected Trinity, hellfire, and immortal soul doctrines. In 1870, he formed a Pittsburgh Bible study, launching *Zion’s Watch Tower* (1879) to publish truth. His *Studies in the Scriptures* reached millions, distributed at churches and homes, despite clergy attacks. Founding the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society (1884), he organized colporteurs to spread tracts. Russell calculated 1914 as Christ’s enthronement (Daniel 4:25, 607 BCE–1914), confirmed by World War I (Matthew 24:7). Persecuted, his works, in the British Museum, London, restored “Jehovah,” as “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10). The New World Translation (vindicate.html, Item 8) built on his efforts.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bible Students:</strong> Followers like Maria Ackley and Alexander Macmillan faced mob violence but preached door-to-door, distributing millions of tracts. Their conventions, like Cedar Point (1919), rallied thousands, as “declare his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24).</p>

                        <p>Modern Jehovah’s Witnesses, led by bold figures, have globalized pure worship, as “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p><strong>Joseph Franklin Rutherford (1869–1942):</strong> Succeeding Russell in 1917, Rutherford faced World War I persecution. In 1918, he and seven associates were jailed for *The Finished Mystery*, criticizing war-supporting clergy. Released in 1919, Rutherford won 43 Supreme Court cases, securing preaching rights, as historical records confirm. Naming the group Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1931 (Isaiah 43:10), he used radio broadcasts and phonographs to share truth globally, as “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1). His conventions, like 1922’s Cedar Point, urged “Advertise the King and Kingdom.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Nathan H. Knorr (1905–1977):</strong> From 1942, Knorr oversaw the New World Translation (1950–1961), restoring “Jehovah” 7,237 times, based on the Leningrad Codex (vindicate.html, Item 6). Founding Gilead School (1943), he trained missionaries for 240 lands. His leadership, in Watch Tower archives, expanded preaching, as “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p><strong>Governing Body (1971–Present):</strong> Guiding Witnesses like Acts 15:2, they face bans (e.g., Russia 2017, 2,000 arrests) but persevere. With 8.7 million Witnesses, 1.4 billion preaching hours, and a website in 1,000+ languages, they uphold neutrality (John 18:36) and aid disasters (Haiti 2010), as “Jehovah loves those who love him” (Psalm 31:23).</p>
