                <h2>THE MESSIAH WOULD BE BORN IN BETHLEHEM</h2>
                <p>Long before Jesus was born, the Hebrew prophet Micah wrote that the promised Messiah would come from a very specific place: the small town of Bethlehem in Judah. This prophecy was given around 700 years before Jesus’ birth and identified not only the location—but also emphasized that the ruler would come “from ancient times,” showing he would have a prehuman existence.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, the one too little to be among the thousands of Judah, from you will come out for me the one to be ruler in Israel, whose origin is from ancient times, from the days of long ago.” — Micah 5:2</p>
                <h3>Jesus Was Born in Bethlehem, Just As Foretold</h3>
                <p>The Gospel of Matthew confirms that Jesus was born in Bethlehem during the days of King Herod. This was no accident—Jehovah directed events so that Mary and Joseph would be in Bethlehem at just the right time. Although they lived in Nazareth, a Roman census required them to travel to Bethlehem, fulfilling the prophecy exactly.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“After Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, look! astrologers from the East came to Jerusalem.” — Matthew 2:1</p>
                <p class="scripture">“So Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem… to get registered with Mary.” — Luke 2:4-5</p>
                <h3>The Chief Priests Knew This Prophecy Too</h3>
                <p>When King Herod heard about the birth of “the king of the Jews,” he asked the chief priests where the Messiah was supposed to be born. They immediately quoted Micah’s prophecy, showing that even the religious leaders at the time understood the significance of Bethlehem.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“They said to him: ‘In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is how it has been written through the prophet.’” — Matthew 2:5</p>

<!-- Prophecy: Born of a Virgin -->
<section class="item">

            <summary class="item-button">Born of a Virgin</summary>
            <div class="item-content">
                <h2>THE MESSIAH WOULD BE BORN OF A VIRGIN</h2>
                <p>Hundreds of years before Jesus was born, Jehovah inspired the prophet Isaiah to give a remarkable prophecy. Isaiah wrote that a virgin—someone who had not had relations with a man—would give birth to a son. This miraculous birth would be a sign from God and a powerful proof of the Messiah’s divine origin.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Therefore, Jehovah himself will give you a sign: Look! The virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and she will name him Immanuel.” — Isaiah 7:14</p>
                <h3>Jesus’ Birth Fulfilled This Prophecy Exactly</h3>
                <p>About 700 years after Isaiah wrote this prophecy, Jehovah caused it to be fulfilled. The angel Gabriel told the virgin Mary that she would give birth to a son by means of holy spirit. This would not be a normal birth. Joseph, her legal husband, did not have sexual relations with her until after Jesus was born. Jehovah was the one who caused Mary to become pregnant.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“But she said to the angel: ‘How is this to be, since I am not having sexual relations with a man?’ The angel answered her: ‘Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. And for that reason the one who is born will be called holy, God’s Son.’” — Luke 1:34-35</p>
                <h3>Matthew Directly Connects This to Isaiah’s Prophecy</h3>
                <p>Matthew, one of Jesus’ apostles, clearly shows that this event fulfilled Isaiah’s prophecy. By quoting it directly, he helps us see that this was no coincidence. Jehovah guided the whole event so that the Messiah’s birth would be a miraculous sign, just as foretold.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“All of this actually came about to fulfill what was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet, saying: ‘Look! The virgin will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel,’ which means, when translated, ‘With Us Is God.’” — Matthew 1:22-23</p>

            <div class="item-content">
                <h2>THE MESSIAH WOULD BE REJECTED BY MEN</h2>
                <p>Centuries before Jesus’ time, Jehovah inspired the prophet Isaiah to describe how the Messiah would be treated by others. Instead of being honored and respected, he would be rejected, despised, and viewed as insignificant by the people. This prophecy accurately foretold how the Jewish nation, especially its leaders, would treat Jesus when he came.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“He was despised and was avoided by men, a man who was meant for pains and was familiar with sickness. It was as if his face were hidden from us. He was despised, and we held him as of no account.” — Isaiah 53:3</p>
                <h3>Jesus Was Rejected by His Own People</h3>
                <p>Although Jesus taught with authority, performed miracles, and showed deep compassion, he was rejected by the majority of people, especially the religious leaders. They accused him of misleading the nation and even of being demon-possessed. Many people turned their backs on him, and even his own relatives didn’t believe in him at first.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“He came to his own home, but his own people did not accept him.” — John 1:11</p>
                <p class="scripture">“For neither did his brothers put their faith in him.” — John 7:5</p>
                <h3>The Leaders Plotted Against Him and Stirred Up the Crowd</h3>
                <p>Instead of recognizing Jesus as the promised Messiah, the chief priests and Pharisees became jealous of him. They rejected his message and plotted to have him killed. They even stirred up the crowd to demand his execution, fulfilling the prophecy that the Messiah would be “held as of no account.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">“However, the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Bar·abʹbas, but to have Jesus put to death.” — Matthew 27:20</p>

<!-- Prophecy: Betrayed for 30 Pieces of Silver -->

            <summary class="item-button">Betrayed for 30 Pieces of Silver</summary>
            <div class="item-content">
                <h2>THE MESSIAH WOULD BE BETRAYED FOR 30 PIECES OF SILVER</h2>
                <p>Over 500 years before Jesus was born, Jehovah inspired the prophet Zechariah to record a very specific prophecy: the Messiah would be valued at just 30 pieces of silver—the price of a common slave—and that money would later be thrown into the temple and given to a potter. This prophecy foreshadowed the betrayal of Jesus and even what would happen to the money afterward.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“So they paid me 30 pieces of silver. Then Jehovah said to me: ‘Throw it into the treasury—the magnificent value with which they valued me.’ So I took the 30 pieces of silver and threw it into the treasury at the house of Jehovah.” — Zechariah 11:12-13</p>
                <h3>Judas Iscariot Fulfilled This Prophecy Exactly</h3>
                <p>Judas, one of Jesus’ twelve apostles, agreed to betray Jesus to the chief priests for the exact amount foretold: 30 pieces of silver. This was a shocking act of disloyalty, and it fulfilled Zechariah’s prophecy with stunning detail. Judas later felt deep regret and returned the money, but the priests refused to accept it back into the temple treasury.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Is·carʹi·ot, went to the chief priests and said: ‘What will you give me to betray him to you?’ They stipulated to him 30 silver pieces. So from then on, he kept looking for a good opportunity to betray him.” — Matthew 26:14-16</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Then he threw the silver pieces into the temple and departed. After that he went away and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said: ‘It is not lawful to put them into the sacred treasury, because they are the price of blood.’” — Matthew 27:5-6</p>
                <h3>The Money Was Used to Buy a Potter’s Field</h3>
                <p>Just as Zechariah’s prophecy said, the silver was used to buy a field from a potter. This detail might have seemed small or unlikely when the prophecy was first written, but it came true exactly.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“So they conferred together and used the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for strangers.” — Matthew 27:7</p>

            <summary class="item-button">Silent Before His Accusers</summary>
            <div class="item-content">
                <h2>THE MESSIAH WOULD REMAIN SILENT BEFORE HIS ACCUSERS</h2>
                <p>Hundreds of years before Jesus was born, Jehovah inspired the prophet Isaiah to write about how the Messiah would respond during his trial. Instead of defending himself with angry words or fighting to prove his innocence, the prophecy said the Messiah would remain silent, like a lamb being led to the slaughter.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“He was hard-pressed and was letting himself be afflicted; yet he would not open his mouth. He was being brought just like a sheep to the slaughtering; and like a ewe that before her shearers has become mute, he also would not open his mouth.” — Isaiah 53:7</p>
                <h3>Jesus Fulfilled This Prophecy Perfectly</h3>
                <p>When Jesus stood before the Jewish high priest, King Herod, and Roman Governor Pontius Pilate, he was falsely accused by religious leaders. Many lies were spoken about him. Yet Jesus remained calm and quiet, just as Isaiah had foretold. He did not fight back or try to escape his arrest. His silence showed his complete trust in Jehovah’s purpose and timing.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“But Jesus kept silent.” — Matthew 26:63</p>
                <p class="scripture">“But he did not answer him, not even a word, so that the governor was very surprised.” — Matthew 27:14</p>
                <p class="scripture">“But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.” — Mark 15:5</p>
                <h3>His Silence Fulfilled Jehovah’s Will</h3>
                <p>Jesus knew that defending himself would not stop what had to happen. He trusted Jehovah completely and fulfilled the role of the “Lamb of God,” willingly offering his life to provide a ransom for mankind.</p>

                <h2>THE MESSIAH WOULD BE PIERCED</h2>
                <p>Hundreds of years before Jesus’ death, Jehovah inspired prophets to write specific details about how the Messiah would suffer. One of those key prophecies described that the Messiah would be pierced, an exact detail that was fulfilled in Jesus’ death.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“They will look to the one whom they pierced, and they will mourn over him as one mourns over an only son…” — Zechariah 12:10</p>
                <h3>Jesus Was Literally Pierced on the Stake</h3>
                <p>When Jesus was executed, he was nailed through his hands and feet, causing extreme pain and fulfilling this prophecy. Even more directly, after he had died, a Roman soldier pierced his side with a spear, just as Zechariah had foretold.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Instead, one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.” — John 19:34</p>
                <p class="scripture">“In fact, these things took place for the scripture to be fulfilled: ‘Not a bone of his will be broken.’ And again, a different scripture says: ‘They will look to the one whom they pierced.’” — John 19:36-37</p>

                <h2>THEY WOULD CAST LOTS FOR HIS GARMENTS</h2>
                <p>Long before Jesus was born, King David was inspired by Jehovah to write a psalm that described the Messiah’s suffering in detail. One striking part of that prophecy spoke about Jesus’ clothing being divided—and about men casting lots to win part of it.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“They divide my garments among themselves, and they cast lots for my clothing.” — Psalm 22:18</p>
                <h3>Jesus’ Garments Were Divided by Roman Soldiers</h3>
                <p>When Jesus was nailed to the stake, the Roman soldiers took his clothes. They divided most of them, but when they came to his inner garment—woven in one piece—they decided not to tear it. Instead, they cast lots to see who would get it, just as the prophecy had said.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“When the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the stake, they took his outer garments and divided them into four parts… But the inner garment was without a seam, being woven from top to bottom. So they said to one another: ‘Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots over it to decide whose it will be.’ This was to fulfill the scripture: ‘They divided my garments among themselves, and they cast lots for my clothing.’” — John 19:23-24</p>

                <p>As Jesus hung on the stake, it was prophesied that his bones would remain unbroken—a striking detail that was fulfilled perfectly. This prophecy was given by Jehovah long before Jesus’ birth, demonstrating the precision of God’s Word.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“He protects all his bones; not one of them is broken.” — Psalm 34:20</p>
                <h3>Jesus’ Bones Remained Unbroken</h3>
                <p>At the time of Jesus’ execution, Roman soldiers usually broke the legs of the condemned men to hasten their deaths. But when they came to Jesus, they found that he was already dead, so they did not break his legs. This fulfilled the prophecy that not a bone of the Messiah would be broken.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other one who had been nailed to the stake with Jesus. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. However, one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.” — John 19:32-34</p>

                <h2>THE MESSIAH WOULD BE BURIED IN A RICH MAN’S TOMB</h2>
                <p>Jehovah didn’t just foretell how the Messiah would live and die—He even foretold how and where Jesus would be buried. This too was fulfilled in detail when Jesus was laid in the tomb of a wealthy man.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“And he will make his burial with the wicked, and with the rich in death, although he had done no wrong and there was no deception in his mouth.” — Isaiah 53:9</p>
                <h3>Jesus Was Buried in the Tomb of a Rich Man</h3>
                <p>After Jesus died, a rich man named Joseph of Arimathea, who was also a secret disciple of Jesus, asked Pilate for permission to bury him. He placed Jesus in his own new tomb, which had never been used before.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“When it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea came… He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that it be given to him.

                <p>The resurrection of Jesus is one of the most faith-strengthening events in all of Bible history. But did the Bible actually foretell it before it happened? Yes—it did! Jehovah inspired prophecies that clearly pointed to the Messiah’s resurrection from the dead.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“For you will not leave me in the Grave. You will not allow your loyal one to see the pit.” — Psalm 16:10</p>
                <h3>Jesus Was Raised to Life on the Third Day</h3>
                <p>After Jesus died, he was placed in the tomb. But on the third day, Jehovah raised him from the dead, just as foretold. The apostles later quoted Psalm 16 to prove this prophecy had been fulfilled in Jesus.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“God resurrected this Jesus, and of this we are all witnesses… For David, on the one hand, did not ascend to the heavens.” — Acts 2:32, 34</p>

                <p>After Jesus was raised from the dead, his work on earth was not yet complete. The Bible had foretold that the Messiah would return to heaven and be exalted to a position of great authority—at Jehovah’s right hand. This prophecy showed that Jesus would be honored and given kingly power.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Jehovah declared to my Lord: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’” — Psalm 110:1</p>
                <h3>Jesus Ascended to Heaven and Took His Place</h3>
                <p>After Jesus’ resurrection, he appeared to his disciples for 40 days and then ascended to heaven. From there, he waited at Jehovah’s right hand until it was time for him to begin ruling as King.</p>

                <h2>THE MESSIAH WOULD BEGIN RULING IN THE LAST DAYS</h2>
                <p>Jesus did not begin ruling as King immediately after ascending to heaven. The Bible foretold that the Messiah would sit at Jehovah’s right hand until the appointed time—when he would begin ruling in the midst of his enemies. This would happen during the “last days” of this world system.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Jehovah will stretch out the scepter of your power from Zion, saying: ‘Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.’” — Psalm 110:2</p>
                <h3>Jesus Began Ruling in 1914</h3>
                <p>Based on Bible chronology, Jehovah’s Witnesses understand that this prophecy began to be fulfilled in 1914, when Jesus was given Kingdom authority in heaven. That marked the beginning of the last days of this world and the start of his rule as King.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed… It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it alone will stand forever.” — Daniel 2:44</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Then I saw in the visions of the night, and look! with the clouds of the heavens, someone like a son of man was coming… To him were given rulership, honor, and a kingdom, so that the peoples, nations, and language groups should all serve him.” — Daniel 7:13-14</p>
                <p>Since 1914, we have seen clear evidence of this prophecy’s fulfillment—including war, famine, disease, and unrest—just as Jesus foretold in Matthew 24. His heavenly Kingdom has begun, and soon, it will bring an end to all human rule.</p>

                        <h2>THE LAMB AND THE SEVEN SEALS</h2>
                        <h3>What the Lamb and the Seven Seals Represent</h3>
                        <p>In the book of Revelation, the Lamb represents Jesus Christ, who is central to God’s purpose of bringing salvation and establishing God’s Kingdom. The Lamb is called so because of Jesus’ sacrifice as a perfect ransom to pay for the sins of humanity. His role is to open the seven seals on the scroll, unveiling God’s judgments upon the world.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"But one of the elders said to me: 'Do not weep! Look! The Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered so as to open the scroll and its seven seals.' And I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth." - Revelation 5:5-6</p>
                        <h3>The Role of the Lamb</h3>
                        <p>The Lamb (Jesus Christ) is the only one worthy to open the seals because of his perfect obedience and sacrificial death. Without his sacrifice, no one could be reconciled to God or receive salvation. As the Lamb, Jesus unveils God’s judgments on the world by opening each seal, revealing what will take place in the last days.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And I saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll, written on the inside and on the outside, sealed with seven seals. And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice: 'Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?'" - Revelation 5:1-2</p>
                        <h3>The Seven Seals and Their Significance</h3>
                        <p>The Seven Seals represent the unfolding of God’s judgment on the world. Each seal reveals a significant event that will take place as God’s Kingdom approaches, culminating in the final battle at Armageddon. These seals, opened by Jesus Christ, reveal various aspects of the tribulation that precede God’s Kingdom replacing human rule.</p>
                        <h4>The First Seal: The White Horse (Christ’s Kingdom Proclamation)</h4>
                        <p>The first seal represents the spreading of Christ’s Kingdom message. This is not a military conquest, but a spiritual conquest through the preaching of the good news. Christ’s rule is established in the hearts of individuals worldwide.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder: 'Come!' And I looked, and behold, a white horse. And the one who sat on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer." - Revelation 6:1-2</p>
                        <h4>The Second Seal: The Red Horse (War)</h4>
                        <p>The second seal reveals war and violence. This represents the conflicts and instability that will erupt as part of the last days, demonstrating the growing turmoil in the world.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, 'Come!' And another horse, fiery red, went out. And to its rider was given the power to take peace from the earth, and that people should slay one another; and a large sword was given to him." - Revelation 6:3-4</p>
                        <h4>The Third Seal: The Black Horse (Famine)</h4>
                        <p>The third seal represents famine and economic hardship, a consequence of the wars and the collapse of political and economic systems. Scarcity will grow, affecting the availability of food and resources.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, 'Come!' And I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, 'A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not harm the oil and the wine!'" - Revelation 6:5-6</p>
                        <h4>The Fourth Seal: The Pale Horse (Death)</h4>
                        <p>The fourth seal symbolizes death as a result of war, famine, and disease. The rider on the pale horse, named Death, and Hades follow, representing widespread death and destruction that will take place.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, 'Come!' And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth." - Revelation 6:7-8</p>
                        <h4>The Fifth Seal: The Souls Under the Altar (Martyrdom)</h4>
                        <p>The fifth seal represents the martyrdom of faithful servants of God who suffer persecution for their stand for the truth. These martyrs cry out for justice, asking God how long they will have to wait before the wicked are punished.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, 'How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?'" - Revelation 6:9-10</p>
                        <h4>The Sixth Seal: The Great Earthquake (Cosmic Disturbances)</h4>
                        <p>The sixth seal heralds a great earthquake and cosmic upheavals, including signs in the heavens and a shaking of the earth. These natural disasters will be a clear sign that God’s judgment is near.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"I looked when he opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood. And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind." - Revelation 6:12-14</p>
                        <h4>The Seventh Seal: Silence in Heaven (Preparation for the Final Judgment)</h4>
                        <p>The seventh seal opens with silence in heaven for about half an hour. This silence marks the solemn preparation for the final judgment, and it sets the stage for the seven trumpets, which announce the final stages of God’s judgment.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour." - Revelation 8:1</p>
                        <h3>The Meaning of the Seven Seals</h3>
                        <p>The Seven Seals are not events happening all at once but represent a series of prophetic signs leading to the establishment of God’s Kingdom. They outline the major tribulations that will unfold, such as war, famine, and death, followed by the persecution of God’s people. The final seal introduces cosmic disturbances, preparing the world for the final battle at Armageddon.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour." - Revelation 8:1</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>THE FOUR HORSEMEN</h2>
                        <p>The Four Horsemen are a vivid and powerful symbol in the book of Revelation. They represent a series of catastrophic events that will occur during the last days, as part of God’s judgment upon the world. Each horseman is described riding a different-colored horse, each bringing different types of destruction to the earth.</p>
                        <h3>The First Horseman: The White Horse</h3>
                        <p>The first horseman rides a white horse, symbolizing conquest and the spread of Christ’s message. The rider holds a bow and is given a crown, symbolizing victory. This event is not a military conquest but a spiritual one, as the message of God’s Kingdom is proclaimed to the world.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder: 'Come!' And I looked, and behold, a white horse. And the one who sat on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer." - Revelation 6:1-2</p>
                        <h3>The Second Horseman: The Red Horse</h3>
                        <p>The second horseman rides a red horse, symbolizing war and bloodshed. This rider is given a great sword, representing the violence and conflicts that will spread across the world. War will be a major feature of the last days, leading to widespread destruction and suffering.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, 'Come!' And another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was granted the power to take peace from the earth, and to make people slay each other. He was given a large sword." - Revelation 6:3-4</p>
                        <h3>The Third Horseman: The Black Horse</h3>
                        <p>The third horseman rides a black horse, symbolizing famine and economic hardship. The rider holds a pair of scales, symbolizing the need to ration food due to scarcity. This represents the worldwide economic instability that will accompany the wars and upheavals of the last days.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, 'Come!' And I looked, and behold, a black horse, and its rider had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, 'A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not harm the oil and the wine!'" - Revelation 6:5-6</p>
                        <h3>The Fourth Horseman: The Pale Horse</h3>
                        <p>The fourth horseman rides a pale horse, symbolizing death and destruction. The rider is named Death, and Hades follows him, symbolizing the vast number of people who will die as a result of war, famine, and disease during this time. The pale horse represents the devastating consequences of the other horsemen.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, 'Come!' So I looked, and behold, a pale horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth." - Revelation 6:7-8</p>
                        <h3>The Meaning of the Four Horsemen</h3>
                        <p>The Four Horsemen represent the tribulations that will occur as the world nears its end. These events, including spiritual conquest, war, famine, and death, will set the stage for the final judgment. They show the severity and scope of the problems that humanity will face, as God’s Kingdom prepares to take its place and bring lasting peace.</p>
                        <p>Each of these four horsemen heralds a particular aspect of God’s judgment, each leading to greater unrest and destruction. However, these events also point to the coming Kingdom of God, which will ultimately bring an end to all this suffering.</p>

        <!-- The Scarlet-Colored Beast -->
        <section class="item">
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">The Scarlet-Colored Beast</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>THE SCARLET-COLORED BEAST</h2>
                        <p>In the book of Revelation, the scarlet-colored beast is a key symbol used to represent political systems and their involvement in persecuting God’s people. This beast is described as having seven heads and ten horns, and it is ridden by a woman, symbolizing a corrupt religious-political alliance.</p>
                        <h3>What Does the Scarlet-Colored Beast Represent?</h3>
                        <p>The scarlet-colored beast symbolizes an end-time political system that is empowered by Satan and opposed to God’s Kingdom. It represents a world system of political powers that, under Satan’s influence, seek to suppress true worship and work in alliance with false religion. The seven heads of the beast represent seven world powers that have dominated history, while the ten horns represent ten kings or rulers who share authority with this beast.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored beast, that was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns." - Revelation 17:3</p>
                        <h3>The Seven Heads</h3>
                        <p>The seven heads of the beast represent seven world powers, each of which had a significant impact on God’s people. Historically, these powers are typically identified as Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and the Anglo-American dual world power. Each of these powers played a role in oppressing Jehovah’s people, culminating in the modern political alliances that continue to challenge God’s Kingdom today.</p>
                        <h3>The Ten Horns</h3>
                        <p>The ten horns of the beast represent ten kings or rulers who will give their power to the beast in the final days. These rulers are symbolic of governments or coalitions that will unite in opposition to God’s Kingdom. This alliance will be part of the global political system that persecutes God’s people during the final years of this world system.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they are to receive authority as kings one hour with the beast." - Revelation 17:12</p>
                        <h3>The Woman on the Beast</h3>
                        <p>The woman who rides the scarlet-colored beast represents false religion, specifically the world empire of false religion known as “Babylon the Great.” She is described as a harlot, symbolizing how false religion has become corrupt and has aligned itself with political powers to persecute true worshipers.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She had a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries." - Revelation 17:4</p>
                        <h3>The Beast’s Destruction</h3>
                        <p>Despite its temporary power, the scarlet-colored beast and the false religious system that rides it will be destroyed by God’s Kingdom. In the final battle of Armageddon, God’s judgment will be poured out on this corrupt system, and it will be replaced by the establishment of God’s everlasting Kingdom.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"The ten horns you saw… will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire." - Revelation 17:16-17</p>

                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">The Eight Kings</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>THE EIGHT KINGS</h2>
                        <h3>Human World Powers in Bible Prophecy</h3>
                        <p>In Revelation 17:10, the apostle John is told:</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"They are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet arrived, but when he does arrive he must remain a short while." - Revelation 17:10</p>
                        <p>These “kings” represent political world powers that have directly affected Jehovah’s people throughout history. The prophecy refers not to individual rulers, but to successive empires that dominate the earth and interact with God’s people from ancient times to the modern day. The Bible identifies eight such “kings.”</p>
                        <h3>The Five That Had Fallen</h3>
                        <h4>1. Egypt</h4>
                        <p>Egypt was the first major world power to oppress God’s people, enslaving the Israelites for centuries. Jehovah humbled Egypt and freed his people by means of miraculous plagues.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"By this you will know that I am Jehovah. I am going to strike the water of the Nile…and it will turn into blood." - Exodus 7:17</p>
                        <h4>2. Assyria</h4>
                        <p>Assyria conquered the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel and exiled its people. But Jehovah foretold and brought about Assyria’s end.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"I will make Nineveh desolate, as dry as the desert." - Zephaniah 2:13</p>
                        <h4>3. Babylon</h4>
                        <p>Babylon conquered Judah and destroyed Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. But Jehovah also foretold Babylon’s swift fall.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"In that very night Belshazzar…was killed, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom." - Daniel 5:30-31</p>
                        <h4>4. Medo-Persia</h4>
                        <p>Jehovah used the Persian king Cyrus to end Babylon’s rule and allow His people to return home.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"This is what Jehovah says…‘I will stir up Cyrus…to open doors before him.’" - Isaiah 45:1</p>
                        <h4>5. Greece</h4>
                        <p>The Greek Empire under Alexander the Great fulfilled prophecy by quickly conquering Medo-Persia.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"The male goat…struck down the ram…and trampled it down." - Daniel 8:7</p>
                        <h3>The Sixth King: Rome</h3>
                        <p>The sixth king “is,” meaning Rome was in power during John’s time. Rome ruled with brutality and persecution, even executing Jesus and oppressing early Christians.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"They led him away to be executed…They fastened him to the stake." - Luke 23:26, 33</p>
                        <p>Rome eventually weakened and fell in 476 C.E., paving the way for the next king.</p>
                        <h3>The Seventh King: Anglo-American World Power</h3>
                        <p>This seventh king is a dual power—Britain and the United States—ruling together especially since World War I. It is during the time of this seventh king that God’s Kingdom was established in heaven in 1914.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom…It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms." - Daniel 2:44</p>
                        <p>But this power will not last long. It will eventually give way to the eighth king.</p>
                        <h3>The Eighth King: The United Nations</h3>
                        <p>The scarlet-colored beast of Revelation 17 symbolizes the United Nations. It is not a separate world power, but a coalition representing global political unity.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"The wild beast…is also himself an eighth king, but springs from the seven." - Revelation 17:11</p>
                        <p>This eighth king exists during the time of the seventh and has no real power of its own—except what is given to it. Jehovah will allow the United Nations and its supporters to carry out His purpose by attacking Babylon the Great, false religion.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"These will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated…For God put it into their hearts to carry out His thought." - Revelation 17:16-17</p>
                        <h3>Jehovah’s Sovereignty Over All Kings</h3>
                        <p>The rise and fall of these eight kings proves that no human government can stand against Jehovah’s will. All of them have been used—or allowed—to fulfill God’s prophecies. But in the end, all human rulership will be replaced by the everlasting Kingdom of God.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"The God of heaven will set up a kingdom…It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms." - Daniel 2:44</p>

                        <h2>PEACE AND SECURITY</h2>
                        <h3>A Declaration from World Leaders, Not from God</h3>
                        <p>The Bible foretells a specific event that will occur just before the great tribulation begins—a global proclamation of “Peace and Security.” The apostle Paul wrote:</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Whenever it is that they are saying, 'Peace and security!' then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them, just like birth pains on a pregnant woman, and they will by no means escape." - 1 Thessalonians 5:3</p>
                        <p>This message will not come from Jehovah or his people. Instead, it will be declared by political, religious, and international leaders who believe they’ve achieved stability in the world. They may see it as the beginning of a new era of peace, perhaps connected to the United Nations, the symbolic “eighth king” mentioned in the book of Revelation.</p>
                        <h3>A False Hope Before the Collapse</h3>
                        <p>The cry of “Peace and Security” may bring celebration and a false sense of hope to the world. Leaders might point to peace treaties, economic cooperation, or diplomatic breakthroughs. But Jehovah sees through this illusion. It will not be true peace.</p>
                        <p>Just as the world begins to feel secure, sudden destruction will begin—starting with the fall of Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"These will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked, and will eat up her flesh and completely burn her with fire. For God put it into their hearts to carry out his thought." - Revelation 17:16-17</p>
                        <h3>A Clear Warning for Jehovah’s People</h3>
                        <p>For Jehovah’s servants, this announcement is not a time to relax. Jesus warned his followers to stay alert. He said:</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Pay attention to yourselves… Keep awake, then, all the time, making supplication… that you may succeed in escaping all these things." - Luke 21:34-36</p>
                        <p>The “Peace and Security” declaration is a clear sign for Jehovah’s people. They will recognize it as a prophetic marker, showing that Jehovah’s day is about to begin. This is why God’s people are encouraged to stay awake spiritually and to keep proclaiming the good news while there is still time.</p>
                        <h3>The Final Warning Before the Storm</h3>
                        <p>This false proclamation of peace will serve as the final calm before the storm. It signals that Jehovah’s judgment is about to begin. Just as labor pains strike suddenly and grow more intense, the destruction of this world’s system will begin abruptly and move quickly.</p>
                        <p>The sudden downfall of false religion will mark the start of the great tribulation. After that, Jehovah will bring judgment upon the rest of the world’s political, military, and economic powers, clearing the way for the full establishment of his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed." - Daniel 2:44</p>

                        <h2>THE GREAT TRIBULATION</h2>
                        <h3>A Time of Distress Unlike Any Other</h3>
                        <p>Jesus foretold that the Great Tribulation would be unlike anything the world has ever experienced. He said:</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again." - Matthew 24:21</p>
                        <p>This is not just another time of war or disaster. It is the first major phase of Jehovah’s final judgment on this system of things. No previous event in history compares to what will happen during this period, and it will never be repeated. Jehovah Himself initiates it, demonstrating His justice and holiness.</p>
                        <h3>What Triggers the Great Tribulation?</h3>
                        <p>The Great Tribulation is triggered after the symbolic cry of “Peace and Security.” Though this announcement will seem like a turning point for global stability, it is quickly followed by a shocking event—Jehovah allows the political powers to destroy Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"The ten horns… and the wild beast will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked… and they will completely burn her with fire." - Revelation 17:16</p>
                        <p>The destruction of false religion is not random—it is part of Jehovah’s will. He puts it into the hearts of world leaders to carry it out.</p>
                        <h3>Jehovah’s People Are Spared</h3>
                        <p>Though the Great Tribulation is a time of judgment, Jehovah protects His people. They are not part of Babylon the Great and have remained separate from false worship. Jesus assured his followers:</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"If those days were not cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short." - Matthew 24:22</p>
                        <p>This means that Jehovah will intervene before the tribulation can wipe out all life. His people, often referred to as the “great crowd,” will be preserved because they stay loyal and clean in Jehovah’s eyes. Their survival is a powerful testimony to Jehovah’s mercy and justice.</p>

        <!-- 666 — The Mark of the Beast -->
        <section class="item">
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">666 — The Mark of the Beast</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>666 — THE MARK OF THE BEAST</h2>
                        <p>666 is the number, or name, of the wild beast with seven heads and ten horns that comes out of the sea.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And it stood still on the sand of the sea. And I saw a wild beast ascending out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns ten diadems, but on its heads blasphemous names." - Revelation 13:1</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"This is where it calls for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the wild beast, for it is a man’s number, and its number is 666." - Revelation 13:18</p>
                        <p>This beast is a symbol of the worldwide political system.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"It was permitted to wage war with the holy ones and conquer them, and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation." - Revelation 13:7</p>
                        <p>The name 666 identifies the political system as a gross failure in God’s sight.</p>
                        <h3>The Significance of 666</h3>
                        <p>Seven typically represents completeness or perfection. Six, being one short of seven, can denote something incomplete or flawed in God’s eyes, and it can be associated with God’s enemies. The Bible sometimes stresses a matter by stating it three times.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"As for the four living creatures, each one of them had six wings; they were full of eyes all around and underneath. And continuously, day and night, they say: 'Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.'" - Revelation 4:8</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven say with a loud voice: 'Woe, woe, woe to those dwelling on the earth because of the rest of the trumpet blasts of the three angels who are about to blow their trumpets!'" - Revelation 8:13</p>
                        <p>So the name 666 powerfully emphasizes that God views human political systems as gross failures. They have been unable to bring lasting peace and security —things that only God’s Kingdom will achieve.</p>
                        <h3>The Mark of the Beast</h3>
                        <p>But, the beast with seven heads that comes out of the water isn’t the only thing under the name 666. The mark of the beast is also tied into the name. But what is the mark of the beast, and how do some get the mark of the beast?</p>
                        <p>The Bible indicates that people receive “the mark of the wild beast” because they follow it with admiration, ultimately leading to worship.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"I saw that one of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded, but its mortal wound had been healed, and all the earth followed the wild beast with admiration. And they worshipped the dragon because it gave the authority to the wild beast, and they worshipped the wild beast with the words: 'Who is like the wild beast, and who can do battle with it?'" - Revelation 13:3, 4</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"The first one went off and poured out his bowl on the earth. And a hurtful and malignant ulcer afflicted the people who had the mark of the wild beast and who were worshipping its image." - Revelation 16:2</p>
                        <h3>Worshipful Honor to the Political System</h3>
                        <p>Those who receive the mark of the beast give worshipful honor to their country, its symbols, or its military might. As stated in The Encyclopedia of Religion, “Nationalism has become a dominant form of religion in the modern world.”</p>
                        <h3>The Mark on the Right Hand or Forehead</h3>
                        <p>How is the mark of the beast placed on someone’s right hand or forehead?</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"It puts under compulsion all people—the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves—that these should be marked on their right hand or on their forehead." - Revelation 13:16</p>
                        <p>In contrast, God’s commands to the nation of Israel were to be internalized, not literally marked on their hands and foreheads.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"You must impress these words of mine on your heart and your soul and bind them as a reminder on your hand, and they should be like a headband on your forehead." - Deuteronomy 11:18</p>
                        <p>This meant that God’s words would guide all their actions and thoughts.</p>
                        <h3>The Symbolic Meaning of the Mark</h3>
                        <p>Rather than a literal mark, such as a 666 tattoo, the mark of the beast symbolically identifies those who let the political system rule their lives.</p>
                        <h3>Opposition to God</h3>
                        <p>Those with the mark of the beast place themselves in opposition to God.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice: 'If anyone worships the wild beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he will also drink of the wine of the anger of God that is poured out undiluted into the cup of His wrath, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb.'" - Revelation 14:9, 10</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the one seated on the horse and against his army. And the wild beast was caught, and along with it the false prophet that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast and those who worship its image. While still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur. But the rest were killed off with the long sword that proceeded out of the mouth of the one seated on the horse. And all the birds were filled with their flesh." - Revelation 19:19-21</p>

        <!-- The Fall of Babylon the Great -->
        <section class="item">
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">The Fall of Babylon the Great</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>THE FALL OF BABYLON THE GREAT</h2>
                        <h3>The Judgment of False Religion Begins</h3>
                        <p>Babylon the Great is a symbol of the world empire of false religion. For centuries, false religion has misled people, opposed Jehovah, and allied itself with political powers. During the Great Tribulation, Jehovah will finally bring judgment against this system. It will be the first visible sign that this world is collapsing.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"She fell! Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling place of demons." - Revelation 18:2</p>
                        <p>This global collapse of false religion will shock people everywhere. Religious institutions that seemed unshakable will be devastated as Jehovah allows political powers to turn against them.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a place for demons to dwell, a haunt for every unclean spirit… for all the nations have drunk the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality." - Revelation 18:2</p>
                        <h3>How Will Babylon the Great Fall?</h3>
                        <p>The symbolic “ten horns” (political powers) and the scarlet-colored wild beast (the United Nations) will unexpectedly turn on false religion. They will destroy her wealth, power, and global influence. The very governments that once supported her will now bring her to ruin.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"The ten horns that you saw, and the wild beast, these will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked, and they will eat up her flesh and completely burn her with fire." - Revelation 17:16</p>
                        <p>These governments will think they’re acting in their own interest—perhaps to bring peace or security—but in truth, Jehovah is guiding these events to accomplish His purpose.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"God put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose, yes, to carry out their one thought by giving their kingdom to the wild beast until the words of God will have been accomplished." - Revelation 17:16-17</p>
                        <h3>Why Does Jehovah Allow This Destruction?</h3>
                        <p>False religion has long misrepresented Jehovah and harmed people spiritually and physically. It has supported wars, promoted immorality, and taught lies about God. Now Jehovah will remove it forever. The fall of Babylon the Great is not an accident—it is His righteous judgment.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Come out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues." - Revelation 18:4</p>
                        <p>Jehovah’s people have already obeyed this command. They are not part of Babylon the Great. That is why they are not harmed when she falls. Her destruction begins the final countdown for this system.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Get out of her, my people, so that you do not share with her in her sins and so that you do not receive part of her plagues." - Revelation 18:4</p>
                        <h3>The World Will Mourn—but Jehovah’s People Will Rejoice</h3>
                        <p>Many will grieve when Babylon the Great falls, especially those who profited from her—politicians, merchants, and religious leaders. But Jehovah’s people will rejoice, knowing this judgment proves that Jehovah is cleansing the earth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Be glad over her, O heaven, and you holy ones and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her!" - Revelation 18:20</p>
                        <p>Her end will be permanent. False religion will never rise again. Jehovah’s justice will be complete.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"With a swift pitch, a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone and hurled it into the sea, saying: 'This is how Babylon the great city will be hurled down, and she will never be found again.'" - Revelation 18:20-21</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>GOG OF MAGOG</h2>
                        <h3>The Final Attack Against Jehovah’s People</h3>
                        <p>After the fall of Babylon the Great, the world will enter its most dangerous moment. The political powers, no longer distracted by false religion, will now unite in an all-out attack on Jehovah’s people. The Bible refers to this global attack as the assault by Gog of Magog.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"You will come against my people Israel like a cloud covering the land. In the final part of the days, I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me." - Ezekiel 38:16</p>
                        <p>This prophecy is not about ancient Israel. It points to Jehovah’s present-day people—those who have dedicated themselves to Him and are standing firm during the Great Tribulation. The world, under Satan’s control, will now attempt to wipe them out completely.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"You will come against my people Israel like a cloud covering the land. In the final part of the days, I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me when I sanctify myself through you before their eyes, O Gog." - Ezekiel 38:16</p>
                        <h3>Who Is Gog of Magog?</h3>
                        <p>Gog of Magog is not a single human or nation. It is a symbolic name for the combined forces of this world, united under Satan after the fall of false religion. These include kings, rulers, military powers, and global institutions who are deceived into thinking they can defeat God’s people.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons… to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty." - Revelation 16:14</p>
                        <p>Satan uses these powers to gather the nations for one final rebellion. But what appears to be a unified military campaign is actually the beginning of their destruction.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty." - Revelation 16:14</p>
                        <h3>Why Does Gog Attack Jehovah’s People?</h3>
                        <p>Jehovah’s people will be the only organized group left standing in support of God’s Kingdom. Without Babylon the Great, and with global systems in chaos, Jehovah’s servants will seem vulnerable—peaceful, unarmed, and without political protection. Gog will believe this is the perfect opportunity.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"You will say, 'I will go up against the land of unprotected settlements… to loot and plunder.'" - Ezekiel 38:11-12</p>
                        <p>But Jehovah sees this attack coming. He will allow Gog to advance—but only so far. Then Jehovah will respond with decisive power, showing the nations that they have gone too far.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"You will say, 'I will go up against the land of unprotected settlements… against people gathered from the nations, who are dwelling in security, all of them living without a wall.'" - Ezekiel 38:11-12</p>
                        <h3>Jehovah Responds to Gog’s Attack</h3>
                        <p>Jehovah will not allow His people to be destroyed. Just as Gog’s forces close in, Jehovah will intervene in the most powerful way. The Bible says He will act with rage, using natural and supernatural forces to protect His people and strike down their enemies.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"My great rage will flare up… I will call for a sword against him… torrential rain, hailstones, fire, and sulfur." - Ezekiel 38:18-22</p>
                        <p>This overwhelming response will begin the final phase of the Great Tribulation. It will be clear to all who is truly in control. Jehovah will sanctify His name before the eyes of the world.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"In that day, my great rage will flare up… I will call for a sword against him… And I will bring my judgment against him with pestilence and bloodshed; and I will rain down a torrential downpour and hailstones and fire and sulfur." - Ezekiel 38:18-22</p>
                        <h3>This Leads Directly to Armageddon</h3>
                        <p>The attack by Gog of Magog sets the stage for the war of Armageddon. As the nations fight against Jehovah’s people, Jehovah’s King—Jesus Christ—will take action. With the heavenly armies, Jesus will strike down all enemies of God’s Kingdom.</p>

                        <h2>ARMAGEDDON</h2>
                        <h3>The Beginning of Armageddon</h3>
                        <p>Armageddon begins when Satan’s world system, represented by the UN (8th king) and the Anglo-American powers (7th king), launches a final attempt to crush Jehovah’s people—the Great Crowd—after the destruction of Babylon the Great. The nations of the world, under Gog of Magog, will unite in opposition to God’s Kingdom, thinking they can wipe out Jehovah’s faithful ones.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty." - Revelation 16:14</p>
                        <p>At the start of this event, Jehovah’s heavenly army (including Jesus Christ and the 144,000) will begin to intervene, bringing judgment upon the wicked and providing protection for the faithful. In this first stage, it will be clear that Jehovah’s Kingdom is established, and the destruction of false religion has already set the stage for the final battle.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty." - Revelation 16:14</p>
                        <h3>The Middle of Armageddon: The Battle and Judgment</h3>
                        <p>The middle of Armageddon is marked by direct divine intervention. The heavenly forces, led by Jesus Christ, will defeat all of Satan’s armies, including the political, military, and religious forces opposed to God’s Kingdom.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse. The one seated on it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness." - Revelation 19:11</p>
                        <p>Jesus Christ’s victory over the forces of Satan at the height of Armageddon will be decisive. The beast and the false prophet—symbols of corrupt religion and corrupt political systems—will be destroyed and cast into the lake of fire.</p>
                        <p>This phase also includes the Judgment of the Sheep and the Goats, marking the division between those who serve Jehovah faithfully (the sheep) and those who oppose His Kingdom (the goats). The righteous will be rewarded with eternal life, while the wicked will face destruction.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"When the Son of man comes in his glory… all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats." - Matthew 25:31-32</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse. The one seated on it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness." - Revelation 19:11</p>
                        <h3>The End of Armageddon: Final Destruction and Peace</h3>
                        <p>The final phase of Armageddon will see the complete defeat of all opposition to God’s Kingdom. The goats (the wicked) will be destroyed in judgment, and Jesus Christ will bring an end to all human rulership and the influence of Satan.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"These will wage war with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings." - Revelation 17:14</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Armageddon, all the armies opposing Christ will be utterly defeated.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"These will wage war with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings." - Revelation 17:14</p>

                        <h2>THE END</h2>
                        <h3>The Destruction of Satan’s World System</h3>
                        <p>After Armageddon, the entire system that Satan has ruled—including all human governments, institutions, and his influence—will be completely removed.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. He seized the dragon, the original serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years." - Revelation 20:1-2</p>
                        <p>Satan and his demons will be bound and abyssed for 1,000 years, unable to mislead the nations during Christ’s Millennial Rule. The world will be free from the corruption and deception Satan has caused throughout human history.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. He seized the dragon, the original serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years." - Revelation 20:1-2</p>
                        <h3>Christ’s 1,000-Year Reign Begins</h3>
                        <p>This marks the start of the Millennial Reign of Jesus Christ alongside the 144,000 anointed ones in heaven. Jehovah’s Kingdom will rule over the earth with righteousness, peace, and everlasting life.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"They will be priests of God and of the Christ, and they will rule as kings with him for the 1,000 years." - Revelation 20:6</p>
                        <p>During this time:</p>
                        <p>Paradise will be restored on earth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit." - Isaiah 65:21</p>
                        <p>Righteous government will bring peace.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"In his days the righteous will flourish, and peace will abound until the moon is no more." - Psalm 72:7</p>
                        <p>People will enjoy perfect health and everlasting life.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"They will be priests of God and of the Christ, and they will rule as kings with him for the 1,000 years." - Revelation 20:6</p>
                        <h3>The Resurrection of the Righteous and the Unrighteous</h3>
                        <p>During the 1,000 years, many who died faithful to Jehovah will be resurrected to life on a peaceful earth. Even those who did not know Jehovah will be given a chance to learn and choose His ways.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out." - John 5:28-29</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"There is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous." - Acts 24:15</p>
                        <h3>Gradual Elimination of Imperfection</h3>
                        <p>During the 1,000 years, obedient humans will gradually be raised to perfection—physically, mentally, and spiritually. This process will restore what Adam and Eve lost.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"On either side of the river was the tree of life… and the leaves of the tree were for the curing of the nations." - Revelation 22:1-2</p>
                        <p>The “trees of life” symbolize the healing and restoration available during this time, as humankind is gradually brought back to perfection.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"On either side of the river was the tree of life… and the leaves of the tree were for the curing of the nations." - Revelation 22:1-2</p>
                        <h3>Final Test After the 1,000 Years</h3>
                        <p>After the 1,000 years, Satan will be released from the abyss for a short time and will try to mislead perfected humans.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And when the thousand years have been ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to mislead the nations." - Revelation 20:7-8</p>
                        <p>Those who choose to follow Satan will be destroyed permanently. Then Satan himself will be destroyed forever—this is known as the second death.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"And when the thousand years have been ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to mislead the nations." - Revelation 20:7-8</p>
                        <h3>Jehovah Becomes “All Things to Everyone”</h3>
                        <p>After Satan’s destruction, Jesus hands the Kingdom back to Jehovah, and Jehovah becomes “all things to everyone.”</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Then comes the end, when he hands over the Kingdom to his God and Father, when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power." - 1 Corinthians 15:24</p>
                        <p>Jehovah will rule the universe directly, and all will recognize Him as King. All that is imperfect will have been removed, and peace will reign forever.</p>
