            <p class="describe">The Bible’s accurate teachings form the foundation of true worship, guiding Jehovah’s Witnesses to honor Jehovah, follow Jesus, and prepare for His Kingdom. These truths, proven by Scripture and practice, lead to everlasting life.</p>

                        <p>Jehovah is the only true God, identified by His name, as Psalm 83:18 declares. Jesus, His Son, is subordinate, sent to reveal Jehovah’s will (John 3:16). Unlike false gods, Jehovah’s sovereignty is proven by His creation and prophecies. Jehovah’s Witnesses honor His name in 240+ lands, distinguishing true worship from idolatry.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“That men may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” — Psalm 83:18</p>

                        <p>The Holy Spirit is Jehovah’s active force, not a person, used to inspire prophets and empower disciples (Acts 2:17). Unlike false views of a triune God, Scripture shows it as God’s power, like wind or fire, guiding true worshipers. Jehovah’s Witnesses rely on this force to preach and live morally.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I will pour out my spirit on all sorts of flesh, and your sons and daughters will prophesy.” — Acts 2:17</p>

                        <p>God’s Kingdom, a heavenly government, will restore earth under Christ (Daniel 2:44). The New Covenant selects 144,000 anointed ones to rule as kings and priests (Luke 22:20; Revelation 14:1). This hope, fulfilled since 1914, drives true worshipers to preach, unlike human governments that fail.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.” — Daniel 2:44</p>

                        <p>The dead are unconscious, awaiting resurrection (Ecclesiastes 9:5). Jehovah’s Kingdom will resurrect billions to earth or heaven (John 5:28-29). Unlike false afterlife myths, this truth comforts true worshipers, as Jehovah’s Witnesses teach globally, offering hope based on God’s justice.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” — John 5:28-29</p>

                        <p>Jehovah grants free will, allowing humans to choose obedience (Deuteronomy 30:19). True worshipers, like Jehovah’s Witnesses, live simply, avoiding materialism (1 Timothy 6:8). This contrasts with false teachings of fate or greed, as the Bible’s moral guidance promotes peace and health.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I have put life and death before you... choose life.” — Deuteronomy 30:19</p>

                        <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses commemorate Jesus’ death annually on Nisan 14, following his command (1 Corinthians 11:24). This simple ceremony—bread, wine, prayers—honors his ransom, unlike pagan festivals. In 2024, over 20 million attended globally, proving true worship’s devotion to Christ.</p>

                        <p>True worshipers preach the Kingdom globally (Matthew 24:14), as Jehovah’s Witnesses do in 1,000+ languages. Their unity, with identical beliefs in 120,000 congregations, reflects God’s spirit (Psalm 133:1). Unlike divided religions, this accuracy shows Jehovah’s blessing on true worship.</p>

                        <p>The Bible’s accuracy—scientific (Isaiah 40:22), historical (2 Kings 20:20), prophetic (Ezekiel 26:12)—guides true worship (Psalm 119:160). Baptism follows dedicated study (Acts 8:36), and discipline keeps congregations clean (1 Corinthians 5:13). Jehovah’s Witnesses uphold these truths, unlike false religions.</p>
