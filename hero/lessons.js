    {
        title: "Does God Have a Name?",
        scriptures: ["Exodus 3:15", "Isaiah 42:8", "Psalm 83:18"],
        description: "Many religions use titles like “Lord” or “God,” but the Bible reveals God’s personal name: Jehovah. This name appears over 7,000 times in Scripture, showing its importance. In Isaiah 42:8, God declares, “I am Jehovah; that is my name.” The name Jehovah, meaning “He Causes to Become,” reflects His power to fulfill promises. The Dead Sea Scrolls confirm its use in ancient manuscripts, unlike vague deity concepts in Babylonian or Egyptian religions. Using Jehovah’s name fosters a personal relationship through prayer, distinguishing true worship from human traditions and building trust in His Word.",
        question: "Why is using Jehovah’s name important for building a relationship with Him?"
    },
    {
        title: "What Is Jehovah Like?",
        scriptures: ["1 John 4:8", "Psalm 89:14", "John 3:16", "2 Peter 3:9", "Psalm 19:1"],
        description: "Jehovah is a loving, approachable God, not a distant deity. The Bible says, “God is love,” with qualities of justice, wisdom, and mercy. He provides creation’s beauty and sent Jesus to die for us. Unlike vengeful gods in Greek mythology, Jehovah is patient, desiring all to know Him. Secular records, like Babylonian chronicles, align with fulfilled prophecies, proving His reliability. Knowing Jehovah’s character builds trust in His guidance over human philosophies.",
        question: "How does Jehovah’s love motivate you to learn more about Him?"

        title: "Why Reflect on Our Spiritual Progress?",
        scriptures: ["2 Corinthians 13:5", "Psalm 26:2", "Galatians 6:4", "Acts 17:11", "Philippians 3:13-14"],
        description: "Reflecting on our spiritual progress strengthens trust in Jehovah. The Bible says, “Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith.” David prayed, “Examine me, O Jehovah,” and Galatians 6:4 urges self-assessment. Unlike ritualistic religions, Jehovah values personal growth, as seen in Paul’s reflection. Historical Christians, like the Bereans, evaluated their faith. Reflection ensures our trust aligns with Jehovah’s standards, preparing us for pure worship.",
        question: "How can reflecting on your spiritual progress deepen your trust in Jehovah?"

    // Worship With Truth Not Tradition (Lessons 31-60)
    {
        title: "Does Free Will Mean No Rules?",
        scriptures: ["1 Peter 2:16", "John 14:15", "Genesis 3:6"],
        description: "Free will is a gift, but not without boundaries. The Bible says, “Be as free people, and yet holding your freedom… as slaves of God.” Many religions misuse free will to ignore God’s laws, but Jehovah requires obedience. Adam’s misuse of free will brought consequences, as historical records of early humanity suggest. Using free will to follow Scripture rejects worldly traditions, ensuring true worship aligned with Jehovah’s standards.",
        question: "How can you use free will to worship Jehovah truly?"

        title: "What Is the Reward for True Worship?",
        scriptures: ["Revelation 21:4", "Psalm 37:29", "Ezekiel 36:24", "Hebrews 10:36"],
        description: "True worship leads to eternal life in paradise. Revelation 21:4 promises, “Death will be no more.” Unlike vague religious hopes, Jehovah’s reward is clear, as fulfilled prophecies like Israel’s restoration confirm. Early Christians endured for this hope, as historical records show. True worship, free from tradition, aligns us with Jehovah’s purpose, ensuring His promised blessings.",
        question: "How does the hope of Jehovah’s reward motivate your worship?"
