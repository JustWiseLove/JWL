                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Wisdom:</b></p>
                        <p>Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge in a way that pleases Jehovah. True wisdom begins with a reverent fear of God and leads to right decisions, clean conduct, and a meaningful life. Jehovah gives wisdom to those who ask with faith and seek his guidance in the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.” (Proverbs 9:10)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Wisdom is the most important thing, so acquire wisdom.” (Proverbs 4:7)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God… and it will be given him.” (James 1:5)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Have Wisdom:</b></p>
                        <p>Wisdom protects us from spiritual danger and helps us live in harmony with Jehovah’s principles. It strengthens our faith, improves our choices, and helps us lead others in a good way. Wise people build strong relationships and walk securely in Jehovah’s favor.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Happy is the man who finds wisdom… It is more valuable than corals; nothing you desire can compare to it.” (Proverbs 3:13, 15)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil.” (Proverbs 14:16)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The wisdom from above is… first of all pure, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey.” (James 3:17)</p>
                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Foolishness:</b></p>
                        <p>Foolishness in the Bible isn’t just about lacking knowledge—it often refers to ignoring Jehovah’s guidance and doing what is right in one’s own eyes. The foolish person acts without thought of consequences or respect for God. Such thinking is spiritually dangerous.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The fool says in his heart: ‘There is no Jehovah.’” (Psalm 14:1)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Fools despise wisdom and discipline.” (Proverbs 1:7)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The heart of the wise one leads him in the right way, but the heart of the stupid one leads him in the wrong way.” (Ecclesiastes 10:2)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Foolishness:</b></p>
                        <p>Foolishness can lead to sin, regret, and even spiritual ruin. It blinds a person to Jehovah’s loving direction and often results in harm to themselves and others. Jehovah encourages us to avoid the path of the foolish and walk with the wise instead.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The wise one fears and turns away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.” (Proverbs 14:16)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A fool gives vent to all his feelings, but the wise one remains calm.” (Proverbs 29:11)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one walking with the wise will become wise, but the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.” (Proverbs 13:20)</p>

            <!-- Holiness - Impurity -->
            <div class="item">

                    <summary class="item-button">Holiness - Impurity</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Holiness:</b></p>
                        <p>Holiness means being clean, set apart, and loyal to Jehovah. He is the ultimate example of holiness and calls his people to reflect this quality in their lives. Being holy involves avoiding moral uncleanness, staying spiritually clean, and keeping close to Jehovah.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must be holy, because I am holy.” (1 Peter 1:16)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Pursue peace with all people and the sanctification [holiness] without which no man will see the Lord.” (Hebrews 12:14)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality.” (1 Thessalonians 4:3)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Have Holiness:</b></p>
                        <p>Holiness helps us stay close to Jehovah and reflects our deep respect for him. It protects us from harmful influences and allows us to serve him acceptably. Those who are holy will be welcomed into his clean new world, where nothing defiled will exist.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Happy are those who are pure in heart, since they will see God.” (Matthew 5:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” (2 Corinthians 7:1)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is near to all those calling on him… in trueness.” (Psalm 145:18)</p>
                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Impurity:</b></p>
                        <p>Impurity includes immoral thoughts, speech, or actions. It makes a person unclean before God and pushes them away from his favor. The Bible strongly warns against uncleanness and lists it among the behaviors that will prevent people from inheriting God’s Kingdom.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“God gave them over to uncleanness in the desires of their hearts.” (Romans 1:24)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness… not even be mentioned among you.” (Ephesians 5:3)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The works of the flesh are… sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct… those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.” (Galatians 5:19, 21)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Impurity:</b></p>
                        <p>Impurity stains our conscience and can damage our relationship with Jehovah. It invites pain, guilt, and consequences. Jehovah lovingly disciplines his people to keep them clean, because he wants them to enjoy a clean conscience and a hopeful future.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Cleanse your hearts, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you indecisive ones.” (James 4:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor.” (1 Thessalonians 4:4)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Flee from sexual immorality! Every other sin… is outside his body, but whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body.” (1 Corinthians 6:18)</p>

            <!-- Gratitude - Ingratitude -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Gratitude - Ingratitude</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Gratitude:</b></p>
                        <p>Gratitude is a sign of humility and appreciation. Jehovah loves when we express thanks for his blessings—both big and small. Jesus often thanked his Father, and we’re encouraged to follow his example by showing thankfulness in our prayers and actions.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good; his loyal love endures forever.” (Psalm 107:1)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“In everything give thanks. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus.” (1 Thessalonians 5:18)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Whatever you are doing… do it in the name of the Lord Jesus, thanking God the Father through him.” (Colossians 3:17)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Have Gratitude:</b></p>
                        <p>Gratitude helps us see how much Jehovah has already done for us. It keeps us joyful and content even during trials. When we’re grateful, we’re less likely to complain or focus on what we lack. It strengthens our relationship with Jehovah and draws us closer to others.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not be anxious over anything… but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.” (Philippians 4:6)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let the peace of the Christ rule in your hearts… and show yourselves thankful.” (Colossians 3:15)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Offer thanksgiving as your sacrifice to God.” (Psalm 50:14)</p>
                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Ingratitude:</b></p>
                        <p>Ingratitude reflects a lack of appreciation for Jehovah’s kindness. It’s often linked with selfishness and arrogance. The Bible warns that people in the last days would be “unthankful,” showing how serious it is in Jehovah’s eyes.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“People will be… unthankful, disloyal.” (2 Timothy 3:2)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him.” (Romans 1:21)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You gave them a king, but in your indignation; you took him away, but in your fury.” (Hosea 13:11 – shows consequences of forgetting Jehovah’s goodness)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Ingratitude:</b></p>
                        <p>Ingratitude can make us blind to Jehovah’s blessings. It leads to complaining, greed, and discontentment. Failing to thank Jehovah weakens our spirituality and can even cause us to drift away from him. A thankful heart, however, helps us remain faithful and joyful.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“How often they rebelled against him… They forgot his deeds and the wonderful works he had shown them.” (Psalm 78:40-42)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Guard against every sort of greed, because even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.” (Luke 12:15)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt.” (Psalm 106:21)</p>

            <!-- Forgiveness - Resentment -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Forgiveness - Resentment</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Forgiveness:</b></p>
                        <p>Forgiveness is a beautiful expression of love and mercy. Jehovah is the perfect example—he is “ready to forgive” those who repent. He also commands us to forgive others from the heart. True forgiveness brings peace and keeps bitterness out of our lives.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is merciful and compassionate… He will not always find fault, nor will he stay angry forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins.” (Psalm 103:8-10)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely.” (Colossians 3:13)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.” (Matthew 6:14)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Have Forgiveness:</b></p>
                        <p>When we forgive, we imitate Jehovah. Forgiveness frees us from anger and helps relationships heal. It also keeps us in Jehovah’s favor, since he will only forgive us if we forgive others. Forgiveness shows strength—not weakness—and brings peace of mind.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Love covers over a multitude of sins.” (1 Peter 4:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered.” (Psalm 32:1)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.” (Colossians 3:13)</p>
                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Resentment:</b></p>
                        <p>Resentment is holding onto anger or bitterness, especially after being wronged. It poisons the heart and leads to hatred, division, and even revenge. The Bible warns that resentment is harmful and can separate us from God’s spirit.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let go of anger and abandon rage; do not become upset and turn to doing evil.” (Psalm 37:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not hate your brother in your heart.” (Leviticus 19:17)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Be wrathful, yet do not sin… Let the sun not set while you are still angry.” (Ephesians 4:26)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Resentment:</b></p>
                        <p>Resentment keeps us from moving forward. It robs us of peace, damages our relationships, and makes us spiritually weak. Jehovah does not hold grudges—and neither should we. Releasing resentment allows us to be truly free and spiritually healthy.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“All bitterness, anger, wrath, shouting, and slander must be removed from you, along with all badness.” (Ephesians 4:31)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“He who cannot forgive others destroys the bridge over which he himself must pass.” (Matthew 18:33, illustration of the unforgiving slave)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit.” (2 Corinthians 7:1)</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Loyalty:</b></p>
                        <p>Loyalty is a deep, faithful love that does not change, even in hard times. Jehovah is the perfect example of loyalty—he remains true to his promises and faithful to those who love him. In return, he expects his people to stay loyal to him, his Son, and one another.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Your loyal love, O Jehovah, reaches to the heavens.” (Psalm 36:5)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” (Revelation 2:10)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Whoever remains loyal in a minor matter is also loyal in much.” (Luke 16:10)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Have Loyalty:</b></p>
                        <p>Being loyal shows that we love Jehovah and trust him. It helps us stay firm during trials, support our spiritual family, and resist pressures from the world. Loyal friends are rare and precious, and Jehovah treasures loyal hearts.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The eyes of Jehovah are on the faithful of the earth.” (Psalm 101:6)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A true friend shows love at all times and is a brother who is born for times of distress.” (Proverbs 17:17)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Love Jehovah your God with all your heart… and be loyal to him.” (Deuteronomy 30:20)</p>
                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Betrayal:</b></p>
                        <p>Betrayal breaks trust and causes deep pain. It shows selfishness and disloyalty, often for personal gain. Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus with a kiss—a tragic example of how far betrayal can go. The Bible clearly warns against this dangerous trait.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Even the man at peace with me, one whom I trusted… has turned against me.” (Psalm 41:9)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed!” (Mark 14:21)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A man lacking good sense betrays confidence.” (Proverbs 11:13)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Betrayal:</b></p>
                        <p>Betrayal brings shame and regret, and it can destroy relationships permanently. Jehovah values loyalty, not people who switch sides or act treacherously. We should never imitate Satan, the ultimate betrayer of God’s trust.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Traitors… have nothing to do with them.” (2 Timothy 3:4, 5)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one who slanders his neighbor is stupid.” (Proverbs 11:12)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah detests a person who causes division among brothers.” (Proverbs 6:19)</p>

                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Obedience:</b></p>
                        <p>Obedience is highly valued by Jehovah. It shows respect for his authority and love for his guidance. Even Jesus “learned obedience” during his time on earth. Obeying Jehovah leads to peace, protection, and blessings.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“To obey is better than a sacrifice.” (1 Samuel 15:22)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome.” (1 John 5:3)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Become doers of the word, and not hearers only.” (James 1:22)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Have Obedience:</b></p>
                        <p>Obedience leads to life. When we follow Jehovah’s instructions, we show trust in his wisdom. It also keeps us safe from spiritual harm. Obedience helps us grow close to Jehovah and prepares us for future blessings in his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Keep following the course of obedience to him, and cling to him, for he is your life.” (Deuteronomy 30:20)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“If you listen to my commandments… I will give the rain for your land at its proper time.” (Deuteronomy 11:13-14)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The obedient one will eat the good things of the land.” (Isaiah 1:19)</p>

                        <p>Disobedience is rebellion against God’s authority. It began with Satan and led to the fall of Adam and Eve. The Bible warns that those who ignore Jehovah’s laws will not receive his favor. Disobedience brings sorrow, disorder, and ultimately destruction.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They refused to listen… and they turned a stubborn shoulder.” (Zechariah 7:11)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“God considers vengeance on those who do not obey.” (2 Thessalonians 1:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one who disregards this is disregarding, not man, but God.” (1 Thessalonians 4:8)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Disobedience:</b></p>
                        <p>Disobedience leads us away from Jehovah’s protection. It breaks our relationship with him and opens the door to sin. Those who keep ignoring his direction will face his judgment. That’s why cultivating a spirit of obedience is vital for our spiritual survival.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“By your stubbornness… you are storing up wrath for yourself.” (Romans 2:5)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They stumble because they are disobedient to the word.” (1 Peter 2:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not be stiff-necked any longer, for Jehovah your God is the God of gods.” (Deuteronomy 10:16-17)</p>

                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Self-Control:</b></p>
                        <p>Self-control is a fruit of God’s spirit. It means having the strength to resist wrong desires, control our emotions, and make wise decisions. Jehovah and Jesus both show perfect self-control. Christians are encouraged to train themselves to think clearly and act with discipline.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“God gave us… power and self-control.” (2 Timothy 1:7)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Like a city broken through and left without a wall is the man who cannot control his temper.” (Proverbs 25:28)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise person keeps it under control.” (Proverbs 29:11)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Have Self-Control:</b></p>
                        <p>Having self-control protects us from harmful choices and keeps us close to Jehovah. It helps us avoid arguments, immoral acts, and regretful words. With self-control, we can resist temptation and remain calm under pressure.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Train yourself with godly devotion.” (1 Timothy 4:7)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Keep your senses, be watchful! Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion.” (1 Peter 5:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been carried out, brings forth death.” (James 1:14-15)</p>
                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Recklessness:</b></p>
                        <p>Recklessness is acting without thinking or care for consequences. It includes doing things impulsively, speaking without thought, or chasing selfish desires. The Bible links recklessness with foolishness and pride.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.” (Proverbs 14:16)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one who guards his mouth protects his life, but the one who talks too much will come to ruin.” (Proverbs 13:3)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“He who hurries to be rich will not remain innocent.” (Proverbs 28:20)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Recklessness:</b></p>
                        <p>Recklessness can lead to serious harm—for us and others. It causes bad decisions, damaged reputations, and spiritual danger. Jehovah wants us to be thoughtful and wise, not impulsive or careless. Avoiding reckless actions helps us stay faithful.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“And I have seen how much effort and skillful work spring from rivalry between people; this too is futility, a chasing after the wind.” (Ecclesiastes 4:4)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself, but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.” (Proverbs 22:3)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A wise person acts with knowledge, but the fool exposes his stupidity.” (Proverbs 13:16)</p>

                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Honesty:</b></p>
                        <p>Honesty is a core part of Jehovah’s standards. He is “a God of truth,” and he expects his servants to speak truthfully and act with integrity. Honesty builds trust, keeps our conscience clean, and brings honor to Jehovah’s name.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not lie to one another. Strip off the old personality with its practices,” (Col. 3:9)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Each of you must speak truthfully with his neighbor.” (Ephesians 4:25)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah detests a lying tongue, but he delights in those dealing faithfully.” (Proverbs 12:22)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Have Honesty:</b></p>
                        <p>Honesty protects us from guilt and regret. It helps us maintain strong relationships and reflect Jehovah’s qualities. Even when it’s difficult, being honest shows spiritual maturity and earns the respect of others. It helps others trust us and the message we share.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“We trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” (Hebrews 13:18)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Conduct yourselves honestly among the nations.” (1 Peter 2:12)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Who may be a guest in your tent?… The one who walks faultlessly, practices what is right, and speaks the truth in his heart.” (Psalm 15:1-2)</p>
                        <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Deceit:</b></p>
                        <p>Deceit, or lying, is the opposite of Jehovah’s truth. Satan is the “father of the lie” (John 8:44), and lies always lead to trouble and harm. Jehovah hates falsehood and will not allow liars to remain among his people.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must not steal, you must not deceive, and you must not lie to one another.” (Leviticus 19:11)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one hiding hatred has lying lips, and whoever spreads slander is stupid.” (Proverbs 10:18)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Outside are the dogs… and all those who love and practice lying.” (Revelation 22:15)</p>
                        <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Deceit:</b></p>
                        <p>Lies damage trust, destroy friendships, and can even cost us our relationship with Jehovah. A dishonest life leads to spiritual ruin. That’s why the Bible tells us to “safeguard our lips” and avoid deception in all things.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A false witness will not go unpunished, and the one who lies with every breath will perish.” (Proverbs 19:9)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (John 8:32)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Put away lies; speak truth each one with his neighbor.” (Zechariah 8:16)</p>

                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Wisdom:</strong></p>
                        <p>Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge in a way that pleases Jehovah. True wisdom begins with a reverent fear of God and leads to right decisions, clean conduct, and a meaningful life. Jehovah gives wisdom to those who ask with faith and seek his guidance in the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.” (Proverbs 9:10)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Wisdom is the most important thing, so acquire wisdom.” (Proverbs 4:7)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God… and it will be given him.” (James 1:5)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Have Wisdom:</strong></p>
                        <p>Wisdom protects us from spiritual danger and helps us live in harmony with Jehovah’s principles. It strengthens our faith, improves our choices, and helps us lead others in a good way. Wise people build strong relationships and walk securely in Jehovah’s favor.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Happy is the man who finds wisdom… It is more valuable than corals; nothing you desire can compare to it.” (Proverbs 3:13, 15)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil.” (Proverbs 14:16)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The wisdom from above is… first of all pure, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey.” (James 3:17)</p>
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Foolishness:</strong></p>
                        <p>Foolishness in the Bible isn’t just about lacking knowledge—it often refers to ignoring Jehovah’s guidance and doing what is right in one’s own eyes. The foolish person acts without thought of consequences or respect for God. Such thinking is spiritually dangerous.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The fool says in his heart: ‘There is no Jehovah.’” (Psalm 14:1)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Fools despise wisdom and discipline.” (Proverbs 1:7)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The heart of the wise one leads him in the right way, but the heart of the stupid one leads him in the wrong way.” (Ecclesiastes 10:2)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Foolishness:</strong></p>
                        <p>Foolishness can lead to sin, regret, and even spiritual ruin. It blinds a person to Jehovah’s loving direction and often results in harm to themselves and others. Jehovah encourages us to avoid the path of the foolish and walk with the wise instead.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The wise one fears and turns away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.” (Proverbs 14:16)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A fool gives vent to all his feelings, but the wise one remains calm.” (Proverbs 29:11)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one walking with the wise will become wise, but the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.” (Proverbs 13:20)</p>

                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Holiness:</strong></p>
                        <p>Holiness means being clean, set apart, and loyal to Jehovah. He is the ultimate example of holiness and calls his people to reflect this quality in their lives. Being holy involves avoiding moral uncleanness, staying spiritually clean, and keeping close to Jehovah.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must be holy, because I am holy.” (1 Peter 1:16)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Pursue peace with all people and the sanctification [holiness] without which no man will see the Lord.” (Hebrews 12:14)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality.” (1 Thessalonians 4:3)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Have Holiness:</strong></p>
                        <p>Holiness helps us stay close to Jehovah and reflects our deep respect for him. It protects us from harmful influences and allows us to serve him acceptably. Those who are holy will be welcomed into his clean new world, where nothing defiled will exist.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Happy are those who are pure in heart, since they will see God.” (Matthew 5:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” (2 Corinthians 7:1)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is near to all those calling on him… in trueness.” (Psalm 145:18)</p>
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Impurity:</strong></p>
                        <p>Impurity includes immoral thoughts, speech, or actions. It makes a person unclean before God and pushes them away from his favor. The Bible strongly warns against uncleanness and lists it among the behaviors that will prevent people from inheriting God’s Kingdom.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“God gave them over to uncleanness in the desires of their hearts.” (Romans 1:24)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness… not even be mentioned among you.” (Ephesians 5:3)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The works of the flesh are… sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct… those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.” (Galatians 5:19, 21)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Impurity:</strong></p>
                        <p>Impurity stains our conscience and can damage our relationship with Jehovah. It invites pain, guilt, and consequences. Jehovah lovingly disciplines his people to keep them clean, because he wants them to enjoy a clean conscience and a hopeful future.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Cleanse your hearts, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you indecisive ones.” (James 4:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor.” (1 Thessalonians 4:4)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Flee from sexual immorality! Every other sin… is outside his body, but whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body.” (1 Corinthians 6:18)</p>

                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Gratitude:</strong></p>
                        <p>Gratitude is a sign of humility and appreciation. Jehovah loves when we express thanks for his blessings—both big and small. Jesus often thanked his Father, and we’re encouraged to follow his example by showing thankfulness in our prayers and actions.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good; his loyal love endures forever.” (Psalm 107:1)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“In everything give thanks. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus.” (1 Thessalonians 5:18)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Whatever you are doing… do it in the name of the Lord Jesus, thanking God the Father through him.” (Colossians 3:17)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Have Gratitude:</strong></p>
                        <p>Gratitude helps us see how much Jehovah has already done for us. It keeps us joyful and content even during trials. When we’re grateful, we’re less likely to complain or focus on what we lack. It strengthens our relationship with Jehovah and draws us closer to others.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not be anxious over anything… but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.” (Philippians 4:6)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let the peace of the Christ rule in your hearts… and show yourselves thankful.” (Colossians 3:15)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Offer thanksgiving as your sacrifice to God.” (Psalm 50:14)</p>
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Ingratitude:</strong></p>
                        <p>Ingratitude reflects a lack of appreciation for Jehovah’s kindness. It’s often linked with selfishness and arrogance. The Bible warns that people in the last days would be “unthankful,” showing how serious it is in Jehovah’s eyes.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“People will be… unthankful, disloyal.” (2 Timothy 3:2)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him.” (Romans 1:21)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You gave them a king, but in your indignation; you took him away, but in your fury.” (Hosea 13:11 – shows consequences of forgetting Jehovah’s goodness)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Ingratitude:</strong></p>
                        <p>Ingratitude can make us blind to Jehovah’s blessings. It leads to complaining, greed, and discontentment. Failing to thank Jehovah weakens our spirituality and can even cause us to drift away from him. A thankful heart, however, helps us remain faithful and joyful.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“How often they rebelled against him… They forgot his deeds and the wonderful works he had shown them.” (Psalm 78:40-42)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Guard against every sort of greed, because even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.” (Luke 12:15)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt.” (Psalm 106:21)</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Forgiveness:</strong></p>
                        <p>Forgiveness is a beautiful expression of love and mercy. Jehovah is the perfect example—he is “ready to forgive” those who repent. He also commands us to forgive others from the heart. True forgiveness brings peace and keeps bitterness out of our lives.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is merciful and compassionate… He will not always find fault, nor will he stay angry forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins.” (Psalm 103:8-10)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely.” (Colossians 3:13)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.” (Matthew 6:14)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Have Forgiveness:</strong></p>
                        <p>When we forgive, we imitate Jehovah. Forgiveness frees us from anger and helps relationships heal. It also keeps us in Jehovah’s favor, since he will only forgive us if we forgive others. Forgiveness shows strength—not weakness—and brings peace of mind.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Love covers over a multitude of sins.” (1 Peter 4:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered.” (Psalm 32:1)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.” (Colossians 3:13)</p>
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Resentment:</strong></p>
                        <p>Resentment is holding onto anger or bitterness, especially after being wronged. It poisons the heart and leads to hatred, division, and even revenge. The Bible warns that resentment is harmful and can separate us from God’s spirit.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let go of anger and abandon rage; do not become upset and turn to doing evil.” (Psalm 37:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not hate your brother in your heart.” (Leviticus 19:17)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Be wrathful, yet do not sin… Let the sun not set while you are still angry.” (Ephesians 4:26)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Resentment:</strong></p>
                        <p>Resentment keeps us from moving forward. It robs us of peace, damages our relationships, and makes us spiritually weak. Jehovah does not hold grudges—and neither should we. Releasing resentment allows us to be truly free and spiritually healthy.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“All bitterness, anger, wrath, shouting, and slander must be removed from you, along with all badness.” (Ephesians 4:31)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“He who cannot forgive others destroys the bridge over which he himself must pass.” (Matthew 18:33, illustration of the unforgiving slave)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit.” (2 Corinthians 7:1)</p>

                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Loyalty:</strong></p>
                        <p>Loyalty is a deep, faithful love that does not change, even in hard times. Jehovah is the perfect example of loyalty—he remains true to his promises and faithful to those who love him. In return, he expects his people to stay loyal to him, his Son, and one another.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Your loyal love, O Jehovah, reaches to the heavens.” (Psalm 36:5)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” (Revelation 2:10)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Whoever remains loyal in a minor matter is also loyal in much.” (Luke 16:10)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Have Loyalty:</strong></p>
                        <p>Being loyal shows that we love Jehovah and trust him. It helps us stay firm during trials, support our spiritual family, and resist pressures from the world. Loyal friends are rare and precious, and Jehovah treasures loyal hearts.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The eyes of Jehovah are on the faithful of the earth.” (Psalm 101:6)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A true friend shows love at all times and is a brother who is born for times of distress.” (Proverbs 17:17)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Love Jehovah your God with all your heart… and be loyal to him.” (Deuteronomy 30:20)</p>
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Betrayal:</strong></p>
                        <p>Betrayal breaks trust and causes deep pain. It shows selfishness and disloyalty, often for personal gain. Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus with a kiss—a tragic example of how far betrayal can go. The Bible clearly warns against this dangerous trait.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Even the man at peace with me, one whom I trusted… has turned against me.” (Psalm 41:9)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed!” (Mark 14:21)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A man lacking good sense betrays confidence.” (Proverbs 11:13)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Betrayal:</strong></p>
                        <p>Betrayal brings shame and regret, and it can destroy relationships permanently. Jehovah values loyalty, not people who switch sides or act treacherously. We should never imitate Satan, the ultimate betrayer of God’s trust.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Traitors… have nothing to do with them.” (2 Timothy 3:4, 5)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one who slanders his neighbor is stupid.” (Proverbs 11:12)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah detests a person who causes division among brothers.” (Proverbs 6:19)</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Obedience:</strong></p>
                        <p>Obedience is highly valued by Jehovah. It shows respect for his authority and love for his guidance. Even Jesus “learned obedience” during his time on earth. Obeying Jehovah leads to peace, protection, and blessings.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“To obey is better than a sacrifice.” (1 Samuel 15:22)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome.” (1 John 5:3)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Become doers of the word, and not hearers only.” (James 1:22)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Have Obedience:</strong></p>
                        <p>Obedience leads to life. When we follow Jehovah’s instructions, we show trust in his wisdom. It also keepsautocomplete
us safe from spiritual harm. Obedience helps us grow close to Jehovah and prepares us for future blessings in his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Keep following the course of obedience to him, and cling to him, for he is your life.” (Deuteronomy 30:20)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“If you listen to my commandments… I will give the rain for your land at its proper time.” (Deuteronomy 11:13-14)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The obedient one will eat the good things of the land.” (Isaiah 1:19)</p>
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Disobedience:</strong></p>
                        <p>Disobedience is rebellion against God’s authority. It began with Satan and led to the fall of Adam and Eve. The Bible warns that those who ignore Jehovah’s laws will not receive his favor. Disobedience brings sorrow, disorder, and ultimately destruction.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They refused to listen… and they turned a stubborn shoulder.” (Zechariah 7:11)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“God considers vengeance on those who do not obey.” (2 Thessalonians 1:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one who disregards this is disregarding, not man, but God.” (1 Thessalonians 4:8)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Disobedience:</strong></p>
                        <p>Disobedience leads us away from Jehovah’s protection. It breaks our relationship with him and opens the door to sin. Those who keep ignoring his direction will face his judgment. That’s why cultivating a spirit of obedience is vital for our spiritual survival.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“By your stubbornness… you are storing up wrath for yourself.” (Romans 2:5)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They stumble because they are disobedient to the word.” (1 Peter 2:8)</p>

                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Self-Control:</strong></p>
                        <p>Self-control is a fruit of God’s spirit. It means having the strength to resist wrong desires, control our emotions, and make wise decisions. Jehovah and Jesus both show perfect self-control. Christians are encouraged to train themselves to think clearly and act with discipline.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“God gave us… power and self-control.” (2 Timothy 1:7)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Like a city broken through and left without a wall is the man who cannot control his temper.” (Proverbs 25:28)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise person keeps it under control.” (Proverbs 29:11)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Have Self-Control:</strong></p>
                        <p>Having self-control protects us from harmful choices and keeps us close to Jehovah. It helps us avoid arguments, immoral acts, and regretful words. With self-control, we can resist temptation and remain calm under pressure.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Train yourself with godly devotion.” (1 Timothy 4:7)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Keep your senses, be watchful! Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion.” (1 Peter 5:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been carried out, brings forth death.” (James 1:14-15)</p>
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Recklessness:</strong></p>
                        <p>Recklessness is acting without thinking or care for consequences. It includes doing things impulsively, speaking without thought, or chasing selfish desires. The Bible links recklessness with foolishness and pride.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.” (Proverbs 14:16)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one who guards his mouth protects his life, but the one who talks too much will come to ruin.” (Proverbs 13:3)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“He who hurries to be rich will not remain innocent.” (Proverbs 28:20)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Recklessness:</strong></p>
                        <p>Recklessness can lead to serious harm—for us and others. It causes bad decisions, damaged reputations, and spiritual danger. Jehovah wants us to be thoughtful and wise, not impulsive or careless. Avoiding reckless actions helps us stay faithful.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“And I have seen how much effort and skillful work spring from rivalry between people; this too is futility, a chasing after the wind.” (Ecclesiastes 4:4)</p>

                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Honesty:</strong></p>
                        <p>Honesty is a core part of Jehovah’s standards. He is “a God of truth,” and he expects his servants to speak truthfully and act with integrity. Honesty builds trust, keeps our conscience clean, and brings honor to Jehovah’s name.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not lie to one another. Strip off the old personality with its practices,” (Col. 3:9)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Each of you must speak truthfully with his neighbor.” (Ephesians 4:25)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah detests a lying tongue, but he delights in those dealing faithfully.” (Proverbs 12:22)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Have Honesty:</strong></p>
                        <p>Honesty protects us from guilt and regret. It helps us maintain strong relationships and reflect Jehovah’s qualities. Even when it’s difficult, being honest shows spiritual maturity and earns the respect of others. It helps others trust us and the message we share.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“We trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” (Hebrews 13:18)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Conduct yourselves honestly among the nations.” (1 Peter 2:12)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Who may be a guest in your tent?… The one who walks faultlessly, practices what is right, and speaks the truth in his heart.” (Psalm 15:1-2)</p>
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Deceit:</strong></p>
                        <p>Deceit, or lying, is the opposite of Jehovah’s truth. Satan is the “father of the lie” (John 8:44), and lies always lead to trouble and harm. Jehovah hates falsehood and will not allow liars to remain among his people.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must not steal, you must not deceive, and you must not lie to one another.” (Leviticus 19:11)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one hiding hatred has lying lips, and whoever spreads slander is stupid.” (Proverbs 10:18)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Outside are the dogs… and all those who love and practice lying.” (Revelation 22:15)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Deceit:</strong></p>
                        <p>Lies damage trust, destroy friendships, and can even cost us our relationship with Jehovah. A dishonest life leads to spiritual ruin. That’s why the Bible tells us to “safeguard our lips” and avoid deception in all things.</p>

                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Peace:</strong></p>
                        <p>Peace is one of the beautiful qualities that come from Jehovah. True peace means more than just the absence of fighting—it includes harmony, calmness, and unity with others and with God. Jehovah is called the “God of peace,” and he wants his people to pursue peace in every part of their lives.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah will bless his people with peace.” (Psalm 29:11)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“If possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men.” (Romans 12:18)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Happy are the peacemakers, since they will be called sons of God.” (Matthew 5:9)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Have Peace:</strong></p>
                        <p>Peace allows us to live calmly, make wise choices, and stay close to Jehovah. It helps us stay united with our Christian brothers and sisters. When we act as peacemakers, we imitate Jehovah and help create a peaceful atmosphere in the congregation and in our families.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that build one another up.” (Romans 14:19)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Clothe yourselves with… peace.” (Colossians 3:12, 15)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Those who love your law enjoy abundant peace.” (Psalm 119:165)</p>
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Conflict:</strong></p>
                        <p>Conflict often comes from pride, selfishness, and lack of love. It leads to division and harm. The Bible shows that stirring up arguments and fights is a sign of spiritual weakness. Jehovah does not approve of those who cause strife.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Hatred stirs up conflicts, but love covers over all transgressions.” (Proverbs 10:12)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Where there are jealousy and contentiousness, there will also be disorder and every vile thing.” (James 3:16)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A man given to anger stirs up strife.” (Proverbs 29:22)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Conflict:</strong></p>
                        <p>Conflict destroys relationships, breaks down unity, and drives away Jehovah’s spirit. If we allow conflict to grow in our hearts, it can damage our spiritual health. Jehovah wants us to turn away from arguing and be quick to forgive and make peace.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Stop being quarrelsome… be gentle toward all.” (2 Timothy 2:24)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let all bitterness and anger… be removed from you.” (Ephesians 4:31)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Anyone loving a quarrel loves transgression.” (Proverbs 17:19)</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Patience - Impatience</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Patience:</strong></p>
                        <p>Patience is a key quality for true Christians. It means calmly enduring difficult situations without giving in to anger or frustration. Jehovah is described as patient, giving people time to change and respond to his guidance. When we are patient, we reflect his love and mercy.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is compassionate and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love.” (Psalm 103:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Clothe yourselves with… patience.” (Colossians 3:12)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The end of a matter is better than its beginning; better to be patient than to be haughty in spirit.” (Ecclesiastes 7:8)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Have Patience:</strong></p>
                        <p>Patience helps us endure trials, get along with others, and wait for Jehovah’s promises. It protects us from saying or doing things we later regret. Developing patience helps us become mature Christians who are better equipped to face tests of faith.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“By your endurance you will preserve your lives.” (Luke 21:19)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let endurance complete its work, so that you may be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything.” (James 1:4)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Love is patient and kind.” (1 Corinthians 13:4)</p>
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Impatience:</strong></p>
                        <p>Impatience often leads to harsh speech, rash actions, and a lack of self-control. It can show a lack of trust in Jehovah’s timing. The Bible warns that impatient people are more likely to fall into anger or discouragement, which can harm their spiritual progress.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not be quick to take offense, for the taking of offense lodges in the bosom of fools.” (Ecclesiastes 7:9)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“An impatient man stirs up strife.” (Proverbs 15:18)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A fool gives vent to all his feelings, but the wise one calmly keeps them in check.” (Proverbs 29:11)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Impatience:</strong></p>
                        <p>Impatience can make us act without wisdom or love. It can damage relationships and push us away from Jehovah’s ways. When we give in to impatience, we stop waiting on Jehovah and may try to take matters into our own hands.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good… Wait eagerly for Jehovah, and he will rescue you.” (Psalm 37:3, 34)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out.” (Galatians 6:9)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one who trusts in Jehovah will possess the land.” (Psalm 37:9)</p>

                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Kindness:</strong></p>
                        <p>Kindness is a quality that reflects Jehovah’s personality. It involves showing compassion, gentleness, and care for others, even when it’s not required. Jehovah expects his servants to be kind in speech and action, treating others with dignity and respect.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you.” (Ephesians 4:32)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“But the fruitage of the spirit is… kindness.” (Galatians 5:22)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is righteous in all his ways and loyal in all his works. Jehovah is near to all those calling on him… He satisfies the desire of those who fear him.” (Psalm 145:17-19)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Have Kindness:</strong></p>
                        <p>Kindness softens hearts, promotes peace, and strengthens the congregation. It draws others to the truth and shows that we are imitating Jehovah and Christ. When we are kind, even in difficult situations, we become a powerful example of true Christian love.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A kind man benefits himself, but a cruel man brings trouble on himself.” (Proverbs 11:17)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Clothe yourselves with… kindness.” (Colossians 3:12)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you.” (Matthew 7:12)</p>
                        <p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Cruelty:</strong></p>
                        <p>Cruelty is the opposite of Jehovah’s loving personality. It involves harshness, coldness, and intentional harm. The Bible shows that cruelty reflects a lack of mercy and love, and it causes pain to others. Jehovah disapproves of those who act with cruelty or violence.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They sharpen their tongue like a sword; they aim their cruel words like arrows.” (Psalm 64:3)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one; He hates anyone who loves violence.” (Psalm 11:5)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The merciful one is kind to his own soul, but the cruel person brings trouble on himself.” (Proverbs 11:17)</p>
                        <p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Cruelty:</strong></p>
                        <p>Cruelty harms our relationships and damages our conscience. It makes us unlike Jehovah, who is tender and compassionate. Cruel actions and speech push others away and can destroy unity in the congregation. We must reject cruelty in all its forms to reflect God’s love.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Remove abusive speech from your mouth.” (Colossians 3:8)</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be removed from among you, along with all badness.” (Ephesians 4:31)</p>

                        <p>Humility is a precious quality that Jehovah loves. A humble person recognizes their need for God, does not boast, and treats others with respect. Humility allows us to accept correction, follow direction, and give glory to Jehovah instead of ourselves.</p>
