            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>Jehovah’s name stands as the most significant and sacred identifier in all of Scripture, appearing over 7,000 times in the original Hebrew and Greek texts, a frequency that highlights its unparalleled importance to true worship and understanding the Creator. This divine name, represented by the Hebrew Tetragrammaton (YHWH), translates to “He Causes to Become,” a meaning that encapsulates Jehovah’s role as the purposeful and dynamic Creator who brings His will into reality. The Bible emphatically states, “I am Jehovah; that is my name; I give my glory to no one else, nor my praise to carved images” (Isaiah 42:8), making it clear that Jehovah alone is worthy of exclusive devotion and that He refuses to share His unique identity with any false god or idol.</p>

            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>This name was first revealed to Moses around 1513 BCE at the burning bush, a dramatic encounter where Jehovah declared, “This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation” (Exodus 3:15). That revelation was not just a label but a promise tied to His eternal purpose—to transform the earth into a paradise populated by perfect humans, as He originally commanded Adam and Eve, saying, “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it” (Genesis 1:28).</p>

            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>Jesus, Jehovah’s obedient Son, reinforced the sanctity of this name by teaching his followers to pray, “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified” (Matthew 6:9), and by affirming, “I have made your name known to them and will make it known, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them” (John 17:26). These statements underscore that knowing and honoring Jehovah’s name is not optional but essential to having a genuine relationship with Him and receiving His blessings.</p>

            <div class="card-header">Satan’s War on the Name</div>
            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>Despite its importance, Satan, the great enemy of Jehovah, has waged a relentless campaign to erase this name from human awareness, a battle that traces back to Nimrod’s rebellion at Babel around 2269 BCE. At that time, rebellious humans gathered to build a tower and declared, “Come, let us build a city for ourselves and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves” (Genesis 11:4), an act of defiance against Jehovah’s authority that sought to elevate human pride over divine rule. This event set the stage for Satan’s ongoing efforts to obscure Jehovah’s identity, a strategy that gained traction centuries later when Jewish scribes, around 300 BCE, began avoiding pronouncing the divine name out of superstition, substituting it with titles like “Adonai” (Lord). This practice carried over into many Bible translations, where “LORD” in all capital letters replaced Jehovah’s name, a move that dilutes His personal identity and fosters confusion about who the true God is. Yet, Jehovah’s mighty acts throughout history shout His name louder than any human effort can silence it. For instance, around 1473 BCE, He parted the Red Sea, where “the waters were split apart” (Exodus 14:21), and then drowned Pharaoh’s pursuing army, as “the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen” (Exodus 14:27-28), proving that no power can stand against the One whose name is above all. Similarly, when Jehovah brought down the walls of Jericho around the same period, “the wall fell flat” (Joshua 6:20) at His command, a physical demonstration of His sovereignty that echoes the declaration, “Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God and the King forever” (Jeremiah 10:10). These events serve as undeniable evidence that Jehovah’s name represents His active presence and unmatched power in the universe.</p>

            <div class="card-header">Historical Suppression of Jehovah</div>
            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>The suppression of Jehovah’s name didn’t stop with ancient superstitions; it intensified as false religion grew in the early centuries of the Common Era, particularly by the third century CE, when apostate Christians began adopting pagan practices and titles that further distanced them from the true God. During this period, the influence of Greek philosophy and Roman traditions crept into the emerging church, leading to a deliberate effort to replace Jehovah’s name with generic terms like “God” or “Lord,” a shift that aligned with the blending of Christian teachings with pagan beliefs. However, Jehovah promised that this erasure would not last forever, as He foretold through the prophet Isaiah, “My people will know my name; therefore in that day they will know that I am the one speaking—here I am” (Isaiah 52:6). This prophecy is being fulfilled today as the truth about His name is restored, supported by historical evidence such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in 1947 but dated to around 200 BCE, which contain numerous instances of the Tetragrammaton in its original Hebrew form. These ancient manuscripts refute claims that Jehovah’s name is irrelevant or outdated, proving that it was cherished and used by His faithful servants long before false traditions took hold. Moreover, archaeological finds like the Moabite Stone, from around 840 BCE, mention “YHWH,” further confirming that Jehovah’s name was known and revered in ancient times, even among neighboring nations. This historical record stands as a testament to Jehovah’s enduring identity and His determination to be known by His people, just as He promised, “You will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you” (Jeremiah 29:12).</p>

            <div class="card-header">Fate vs. Free Will</div>
            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>One of Satan’s most insidious lies, propagated through ancient Babylonian astrology around 2000 BCE, is the concept of fate—an unchangeable destiny that strips humans of choice and accountability, locking them into a predetermined path they cannot escape. This belief, which spread through cultures like the Babylonians and later the Greeks, suggested that the stars or gods dictated every event, leaving no room for personal decision or divine mercy. In stark contrast, Jehovah’s Word dismantles this falsehood by affirming the gift of free will, as He told the Israelites, “See, I have set before you today life and good, and death and bad... therefore choose life so that you and your offspring may live” (Deuteronomy 30:19-20). This command makes it clear that humans are not puppets controlled by fate but beings created with the ability to choose their course, a freedom that reflects Jehovah’s justice and love. A powerful example of this principle is seen in His dealings with Nineveh around 830 BCE, when He sent Jonah to warn that wicked city of impending destruction, saying, “Only forty days more, and Nineveh will be overthrown” (Jonah 3:4). Yet, when the Ninevites repented, “God saw their works—that they had turned back from their evil ways—and he felt regret over the calamity that he had spoken of bringing on them, and he did not bring it” (Jonah 3:10). This dramatic turnaround proves that Jehovah responds to human choices, not a fixed destiny, and that He delights in mercy when people turn to Him, as He says, “I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked one should turn back from his way and live” (Ezekiel 33:11). Thus, the lie of fate is exposed as a tool of Satan to rob humans of hope, while Jehovah’s truth offers freedom and life through the exercise of free will in harmony with His will.</p>

            <div class="card-header">Satan’s Lies Unveiled</div>
            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>Satan, “the father of the lie” (John 8:44), began deceiving humanity in Eden with “You positively will not die” (Genesis 3:4), a falsehood that birthed every distortion of Jehovah’s truth, blinding billions, for “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19). After the apostles’ death, he infiltrated the Christian congregation, as Paul warned, “Savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock” (Acts 20:29-30), twisting pure worship into a mix of paganism and lies by the second century CE. His deceptions—holidays like Christmas, doctrines like hellfire, and theories like evolution—enslave minds, as “the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers” (2 Corinthians 4:4). Jehovah exposed this when He struck Ananias and Sapphira dead for lying, “You have lied, not to men, but to God” (Acts 5:4-5), showing His hatred for falsehood.</p>
                <p>From Babel’s tower around 2269 BCE, where “Jehovah scattered them” (Genesis 11:9), to Rome’s pagan revival under Julian in 361 CE, Satan has opposed Jehovah’s purpose, yet his lies crumble under scrutiny. Evolution lacks fossils of transitional forms—apes to humans remain unproven—and no science validates an afterlife, only “dust you are and to dust you will return” (Genesis 3:19). Jehovah’s truth prevails, as “you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:32), and His judgment looms, for “the Devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:10).</p>

            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>Jehovah is the supreme Creator of all things, and He brought the universe into existence through His firstborn Son, Jesus, whom the Bible describes as “the firstborn of all creation” (Colossians 1:15) and “the beginning of the creation by God” (Revelation 3:14). This act of creation unfolded over six creative days, not literal 24-hour periods but vast epochs during which Jehovah prepared the earth step-by-step for human habitation, culminating in His command to Adam and Eve, “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it” (Genesis 1:28).</p>

                <p>The Bible opens with the majestic declaration, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1), a statement that establishes Jehovah as the sole source of all life and matter, a truth echoed by the psalmist who marveled, “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom” (Psalm 104:24).</p>

                <p>Scientific evidence supports this divine act, such as the sudden appearance of complex life forms during the Cambrian Explosion around 540 million years ago, a geological event where fully formed creatures like trilobites emerged without any evolutionary precursors, contradicting the gradual development claimed by Darwin’s theory. Furthermore, the human genome, with its 3 billion base pairs of DNA in each cell, stands as a masterpiece of design, a molecular code so intricate that it defies the notion of random chance, pointing instead to a purposeful intelligence behind it—Jehovah, who “stretched out the heavens by himself” (Isaiah 44:24).</p>

            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>The earth itself bears witness to Jehovah’s thoughtful creation, designed with precision to sustain life in ways that random processes could never achieve. Its 23.5-degree axial tilt ensures the seasons, allowing crops to grow and ecosystems to thrive, while its magnetic field shields it from deadly solar radiation, and its water cycle provides the fresh water essential for all living things. As the Bible states, “He did not create it simply for nothing, but he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18), a purpose that evolution cannot explain. Satan, however, has promoted the lie of evolution to blind humanity to Jehovah’s handiwork, claiming life arose by chance over millions of years. Yet, the fossil record lacks transitional forms—there are no half-fish, half-reptile creatures or other “missing links” to bridge species, a gap that evolutionists struggle to fill. Even radiometric dating, often cited to support an ancient earth, falters under scrutiny; for example, volcanic rocks formed at Mount St. Helens in 1980 were tested and dated as millions of years old, exposing the method’s unreliability. Jehovah’s creation stands firm against such falsehoods, as He declares, “The heavens are declaring the glory of God; the skies above proclaim the work of his hands” (Psalm 19:1), inviting all to see His wisdom in the world around them.</p>

            <div class="card-header">The Great Flood</div>
            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>Around 2370 BCE, Jehovah executed a global flood that reshaped the earth and wiped out a corrupt, violent civilization, an event He announced to Noah with the words, “I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy from under the heavens all flesh in which there is the breath of life” (Genesis 6:17). This was no mere local deluge but a cataclysmic judgment that spared only Noah, his family, and representatives of every animal kind, preserved in an ark that Jehovah instructed Noah to build, saying, “Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood” (Genesis 6:14). The ark, measuring 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high (Genesis 6:15)—approximately 450 feet by 75 feet by 45 feet—was a marvel of divine engineering, its dimensions aligning with the stability ratios of modern ships, ensuring it could withstand the raging waters. Evidence of this flood abounds in the geological record, such as the Karoo Formation in South Africa, which contains an estimated 800 billion vertebrate fossils buried in vast sedimentary layers, a testament to rapid, catastrophic burial rather than slow accumulation over eons. Similarly, coal seams and oil deposits worldwide, formed from massive amounts of organic material, point to a sudden, global upheaval consistent with the Bible’s account. Flood legends from cultures like the Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic, dated to around 2000 BCE, and the Chinese tale of Nuwa, echo this event, preserving a collective memory of Jehovah’s judgment, which He promised never to repeat, saying, “Never again will all flesh be destroyed by the waters of a flood” (Genesis 9:11).</p>

            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>Jehovah created animals “according to their kinds” (Genesis 1:25), a process that produced distinct categories of life—birds, fish, mammals, and more—each perfectly suited to its environment and role in the earth’s ecosystem. This biblical truth stands in sharp contrast to evolution’s claim that all life evolved from a single ancestor, a theory that requires countless intermediate forms that simply do not exist in the fossil record. Consider the complexity of animal features like the eagle’s eye, with its ability to spot prey from miles away, or the bat’s echolocation, a sonar system so precise it detects insects in mid-flight—these are examples of irreducible complexity, meaning they require all parts to function and could not have developed gradually. Jehovah’s care for His creation is evident in His words, “Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them” (Matthew 6:26), and “Not one sparrow is forgotten in God’s sight” (Luke 12:6), showing that He sustains even the smallest creatures. Scientific studies, such as those on the bombardier beetle, which fires a boiling chemical spray to deter predators, reveal systems so intricate that they defy step-by-step evolution, pointing instead to a deliberate act of creation by Jehovah, who “made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds” (Genesis 1:25) in a display of wisdom and power that continues to amaze those who study His works.</p>

This worship is not a casual or optional act but a way of life defined by doing Jehovah’s will, as Jesus warned, “Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will” (Matthew 7:21).</p>

            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>The history of true worship is marked by perseverance through persecution, a test that has refined and strengthened Jehovah’s servants across the ages. In 64 CE, the Roman Emperor Nero falsely blamed Christians for the great fire of Rome, subjecting them to horrific tortures—some were sewn into animal skins and torn apart by dogs, others were burned alive as human torches—yet their faith endured, as “they went away from the Sanhedrin rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored for the sake of that name” (Acts 5:41). This scattering only spread the good news further, fulfilling the pattern seen when “a great persecution arose against the congregation in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria” (Acts 8:1-4). Today, true worshipers continue this legacy by remaining “no part of the world” (John 17:16), refusing to participate in politics, wars, or nationalistic fervor, a stand that mirrors Daniel’s refusal to bow to King Darius’ image around 539 BCE, when he chose the lions’ den over compromise (Daniel 6:10-16). Jehovah honors such loyalty, promising, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), and He expects His worshipers to reflect His holiness, as Jesus taught, “You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth” (John 4:24), a call to worship that is active, informed, and unwavering.</p>

            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>The good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom is the central message of true worship, a promise of a real government that will soon transform the earth into a paradise, as foretold in the prophecy, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed... it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it alone will stand forever” (Daniel 2:44). This Kingdom, led by Jesus Christ, offers hope for a world free of suffering, where “the righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29), and it fulfills Jehovah’s original purpose for humanity, which He expressed in Eden. Jesus taught his followers to pray for this solution, saying, “Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth” (Matthew 6:10), a prayer that has been answered in part since 1914, when Christ began ruling, and will be fully realized when “a new heavens and a new earth” emerge (2 Peter 3:13). This message has been preached since Jesus’ day, when he “went through the cities and villages, teaching and continuing his journey, proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom of God” (Luke 8:1), and it continues today through a global effort that reaches billions, proving that Jehovah’s worshipers are not passive but active heralds of His coming reign, as He commands, “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19).</p>

            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>Baptism is a sacred, public declaration of dedication to Jehovah, a step that every true worshiper must take to symbolize their commitment to His service, as Jesus instructed, “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit” (Matthew 28:19). This is not a ritual for infants, as some false religions practice, but a conscious choice made by adults who understand its meaning, following the example of Jesus, who was baptized at about 30 years old, when “the heavens were opened up to him” (Matthew 3:16-17; Luke 3:23). The act represents a request to God for a clean conscience, as Peter explained, “Baptism, which corresponds to this, is now saving you (not by the removal of the filth of the flesh, but by the request made to God for a good conscience), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ” (1 Peter 3:21). This practice dates back to the first century, when thousands were baptized after hearing the truth, such as the 3,000 on Pentecost who “were baptized and added on that day” (Acts 2:41), but it stands in contrast to the pagan-influenced infant baptisms introduced by Christendom in the fourth century CE, a tradition with no scriptural basis. Jehovah views baptism as a serious vow, and He expects those who take it to live up to it, as “the one who endures to the end is the one who will be saved” (Matthew 24:13).</p>

            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>True worshipers maintain strict neutrality in the world’s conflicts, a principle rooted in Jesus’ declaration, “My Kingdom is no part of this world. If my Kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought” (John 18:36), which sets them apart from the political and military entanglements that dominate human society. In the first century, early Christians faced death rather than serve in Rome’s armies or honor its emperors as gods, a stand that led to martyrdom in arenas where “they overcame because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their witnessing” (Revelation 12:11). This neutrality reflects Jehovah’s own impartiality, as He says, “I am Jehovah, who exercises loyal love, justice, and righteousness in the earth” (Jeremiah 9:24), and it aligns with His command to “love your enemies and pray for those persecuting you” (Matthew 5:44), rather than taking sides in human disputes. Today, this stance is evident when true worshipers refuse to salute flags, vote in elections, or fight in wars, choices that often bring persecution but fulfill the call to be “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14), separate from Satan’s system, which “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19). Jehovah promises protection to those who remain faithful, as He did for Daniel in the lions’ den (Daniel 6:22), ensuring that “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17).</p>

This rebellion began at Babel around 2269 BCE, when Nimrod led humanity to defy Jehovah, saying, “Come, let us build a city for ourselves and a tower with its top in the heavens” (Genesis 11:4), an act that prompted Jehovah to confuse their languages and scatter them, declaring, “Jehovah scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth” (Genesis 11:9).</p>

            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>From Nimrod’s pagan towers to the ornate churches of today, false worship has blended truth with lies, enslaving billions under Satan’s influence, as Jesus described the religious leaders of his day, “You are from your father the Devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father” (John 8:44). This deception spans history, from the ziggurats of Mesopotamia to the cathedrals of Christendom, all marked by idolatry and doctrines that defy Jehovah’s Word. For example, Jehovah struck down 3,000 Israelites for worshiping the golden calf around 1513 BCE, declaring, “Whoever is for Jehovah, come to me!” (Exodus 32:26-28), a swift punishment that shows His intolerance for mixing His worship with paganism. Today, false religion continues to thrive on holidays, clergy hierarchies, and rituals that have no basis in Scripture, but Jehovah’s judgment looms, as He promises, “In one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire, because Jehovah God who judged her is strong” (Revelation 18:8). True worshipers must flee this corrupt system, heeding the call to “worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters” (Revelation 14:7).</p>

            <div class="card-content" style="display: block;">
                <p>The celebration of Christmas, widely accepted as a Christian holiday, actually originates from pagan festivals like Rome’s Saturnalia, a week-long revelry of feasting and gift-giving that began around 217 BCE, and the worship of Mithra, a Persian god whose birth was celebrated on December 25. The Bible provides no command to celebrate Jesus’ birth, and the account of his nativity notes that “shepherds were living out of doors and keeping watch in the night over their flocks” (Luke 2:8), a detail suggesting an autumn birth, likely in September or October, when shepherds in Judea still tended flocks outdoors, not a winter date like December 25. This pagan origin was cemented in 336 CE, when Emperor Constantine, seeking to unify his empire’s Christians and pagans, officially merged these traditions into a “Christian” holiday, a move that Scripture never endorses. Jehovah forbids adopting such customs, warning, “Do not learn the way of the nations... for the customs of the peoples are a delusion” (Jeremiah 10:2-3), yet Christmas persists with its trees, lights, and Santa Claus—elements rooted in Germanic and Norse mythology, not the Bible. True worshipers reject this festival, knowing that Jehovah demands worship “in truth” (John 4:24), not through lies borrowed from idolaters.</p>

                <p>Easter, another cornerstone of false worship, fuses the commemoration of Jesus’ resurrection with pagan fertility rites, a blending that traces back to the worship of Eostre, an Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring whose festival, marked by eggs and rabbits as symbols of new life, was absorbed into Christianity around the eighth century CE. The Bible commands Christians to remember Jesus’ death, not his resurrection, as he instructed, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19) at the Lord’s Evening Meal, with no mention of a yearly resurrection festival. Jehovah condemned such mixing of worship, as seen when He punished Israel for adopting Canaanite practices, saying, “They kept sacrificing to Baal” (Hosea 11:2), a sin that led to exile. Easter’s eggs and sunrise services echo Babylonian and Egyptian rituals from 2000 BCE, not Jehovah’s truth, and stand as “a delusion” (Jeremiah 10:3) that true worshipers avoid to maintain purity before Him.</p>

                <p>The Trinity doctrine, formalized at the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE under Constantine’s influence, falsely claims that Jehovah, Jesus, and the holy spirit are one God in three persons, a concept rooted in Babylonian triads like Anu, Enlil, and Ea from around 2000 BCE, and later Egyptian gods like Osiris, Isis, and Horus. Scripture refutes this, declaring, “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah” (Deuteronomy 6:4), and identifying Jesus as “the firstborn of all creation” (Colossians 1:15), a distinct, created being subordinate to Jehovah, who alone is “the only true God” (John 17:3). The holy spirit is Jehovah’s active force, not a person, as shown when “the spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters” (Genesis 1:2). This pagan lie, solidified by apostate Christianity in the fourth century, contradicts Jehovah’s clear identity and Jesus’ own words, “The Father is greater than I am” (John 14:28), making it a cornerstone of false worship that Jehovah will soon destroy.</p>

The Bible states, “The dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5), proving that mediums commune with demons, not departed souls, a lie Satan used in Eden, saying, “You will not die” (Genesis 3:4). When King Saul consulted a medium at En-dor around 1117 BCE, he invited Jehovah’s wrath, and “Jehovah put him to death” (1 Chronicles 10:13-14). Today’s séances and ghost stories continue this ancient fraud, but Jehovah’s truth exposes it, promising resurrection, not afterlife communication (John 5:28-29).</p>

The Bible declares, “It is reserved for men to die once for all time” (Hebrews 9:27), and “the soul that sins—it itself will die” (Ezekiel 18:4), leaving no room for rebirth.

That year, World War I erupted, fulfilling Jesus’ words, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom” (Matthew 24:7), marking the “last days” (2 Timothy 3:1) with unprecedented war, famine, and earthquakes.</p>

Daniel’s vision of a statue (Daniel 2:31-44)—with its gold, silver, bronze, iron, and clay representing Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and Anglo-American powers—ends with a stone “cut out not by hands” smashing it, symbolizing God’s Kingdom in 1914, when the British Empire and its allies faltered in war. Ezekiel’s “overturning” of rulership (Ezekiel 21:27) until “the one who has the legal right” comes aligns with 607 BCE to 1914, as does Revelation’s “war in heaven” (Revelation 12:7-9), tying Satan’s ousting to global upheaval.
