                title: "1. Why Study the Bible?", 
                instruction: "The Bible stands as Jehovah’s inspired Word, a divine gift distinct from human philosophies or religious texts rooted in false worship, such as pagan myths or materialistic ideologies. It reveals God’s will and purpose for humanity, offering guidance for life’s challenges, as affirmed by 2 Timothy 3:16: 'All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.' Historically, its preservation through centuries—despite attempts to suppress it—demonstrates divine protection. Scientifically, its references, like the earth’s suspension (Job 26:7), align with later discoveries, proving its reliability. Studying it equips us to reject false teachings, like idol worship or soul immortality, and fosters a relationship with Jehovah based on truth.", 
                description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Wisdom and protection from false teachings.", 
                example: "<b>2 Timothy 3:16</b> - All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.\n<b>Joshua 1:8</b> - This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth, and you must read it in an undertone day and night.\n<b>Psalm 119:105</b> - Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light for my path." 
            },
            { 
                title: "2. Who Wrote the Bible?", 
                instruction: "The Bible was penned by over 40 human writers—kings, prophets, fishermen—spanning 1,600 years, yet its unity stems from Jehovah’s holy spirit, as 2 Peter 1:21 states: 'Men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.' Unlike pagan texts filled with contradictory myths, its consistent message across centuries proves divine authorship. Historically, its composition began with Moses around 1513 B.C.E. and concluded with John’s writings around 98 C.E., surviving persecution and translation into thousands of languages. Science supports its accuracy, such as the hydrologic cycle in Job 36:27-28, predating modern understanding. This refutes false worship’s claim of human origin, affirming Jehovah as its true Author.", 
                description: "<b>History:</b> Unified over 1,600 years.", 
                example: "<b>2 Peter 1:21</b> - Men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.\n<b>2 Timothy 3:16</b> - All Scripture is inspired of God.\n<b>Isaiah 40:8</b> - The word of our God endures forever." 
            },
            { 
                title: "3. Is the Bible Scientifically Accurate?", 
                instruction: "The Bible’s scientific accuracy shines through statements made long before human discovery, such as Job 26:7: 'He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.' This aligns with the earth’s suspension in space, a fact unknown in ancient times. Unlike false worship’s flat-earth myths or Babylonian cosmologies, Isaiah 40:22 describes Jehovah as 'the One who dwells above the circle of the earth,' hinting at its spherical shape. Historically, its sanitation laws (Leviticus 11-15) predate germ theory, saving lives. These facts dismantle claims of inaccuracy, proving the Bible’s divine origin and its superiority over pagan falsehoods.", 
                description: "<b>Science:</b> Earth’s shape and suspension.", 
                example: "<b>Job 26:7</b> - He suspends the earth upon nothing.\n<b>Isaiah 40:22</b> - He dwells above the circle of the earth.\n<b>Job 36:27-28</b> - He draws up the drops of water; they filter as rain." 
            },
            { 
                title: "4. What Is God’s Name?", 
                instruction: "Jehovah, God’s personal name, appears over 7,000 times in the original texts, as Psalm 83:18 declares: 'You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.' False worship obscures this name with titles like 'Lord,' a practice rooted in superstition and tradition, not Scripture. Historically, the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) was revered by Israel, yet removed by later scribes influenced by pagan customs. Science offers no contradiction, but the Bible’s consistent use across millennia confirms its authenticity. Knowing Jehovah’s name sets true worship apart from the nameless deities of false religion.", 
                description: "<b>Origin:</b> YHWH, often removed.", 
                example: "<b>Psalm 83:18</b> - You, whose name is Jehovah, are the Most High.\n<b>Exodus 3:15</b> - Jehovah... this is my name forever.\n<b>Isaiah 42:8</b> - I am Jehovah. That is my name." 
            },
            { 
                title: "5. Who Is Jesus Christ?", 
                instruction: "Jesus Christ is Jehovah’s firstborn Son, not God Almighty, as Colossians 1:15 states: 'He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.' False worship, like the Trinity doctrine from pagan triads, equates him with Jehovah, but Scripture distinguishes them. Historically, Jesus’ role as Messiah was foretold (Isaiah 9:6) and fulfilled in 29 C.E., initiating Christianity. Science aligns with his miracles, like healing, as acts of divine power, not myth. He’s the ransom and future King, refuting false claims of co-equality and affirming Jehovah’s supremacy in true worship.", 
                description: "<b>Role:</b> Son and Savior.", 
                example: "<b>Colossians 1:15</b> - The firstborn of all creation.\n<b>John 3:16</b> - God gave his only-begotten Son.\n<b>1 Timothy 2:5</b> - One God, and one mediator, Christ Jesus." 
            },
            { 
                title: "6. What Is the Holy Spirit?", 
                instruction: "The holy spirit is Jehovah’s active force, not a person, as Genesis 1:2 reveals: 'God’s active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.' False worship’s Trinity portrays it as a deity, borrowing from pagan trios like Egypt’s Osiris-Isis-Horus, but the Bible shows it as God’s power at work. Historically, it inspired prophets and empowered Jesus’ miracles (Luke 4:1). Scientifically, its effects—like creation’s order—suggest a purposeful force, not a random entity. Understanding this counters false teachings and honors Jehovah’s true nature.", 
                description: "<b>Use:</b> God’s power.", 
                example: "<b>Genesis 1:2</b> - God’s active force was moving.\n<b>Job 26:13</b> - By his spirit the heavens were made.\n<b>Luke 4:1</b> - Jesus, full of holy spirit." 
            },
            { 
                title: "7. Why Did God Create the Earth?", 
                instruction: "Jehovah created the earth as a permanent home for humanity, as Isaiah 45:18 affirms: 'He is the One who formed the earth... who firmly established it, who did not create it simply for nothing, but formed it to be inhabited.' False worship teaches a temporary earth or soul ascension, echoing pagan afterlife myths, but the Bible promises an eternal paradise. Historically, Genesis records this purpose from creation’s start. Science supports an earth designed for life—its water, air, and ecosystems—refuting chance. This truth inspires hope in Jehovah’s original plan.", 
                description: "<b>Purpose:</b> A lasting home.", 
                example: "<b>Psalm 104:5</b> - The earth will not be moved forever.\n<b>Isaiah 45:18</b> - He formed it to be inhabited.\n<b>Genesis 1:28</b> - Fill the earth and subdue it." 
            },
            { 
                title: "8. What Is Sin?", 
                instruction: "Sin is any act or thought that misses Jehovah’s perfect standards, inherited from Adam, as Romans 3:23 states: 'All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.' False worship minimizes sin with rituals or excuses, like pagan sacrifices to appease gods, but the Bible calls it rebellion against Jehovah. Historically, sin entered through Adam’s disobedience in Eden (Genesis 3). Science shows human imperfection—disease and death—as sin’s effects, not evolution’s design. Recognizing sin’s gravity drives us to seek Jehovah’s forgiveness, not human solutions.", 
                description: "<b>Origin:</b> Rebellion against God.", 
                example: "<b>Romans 3:23</b> - All have sinned.\n<b>Genesis 3:6</b> - She took some of its fruit and ate.\n<b>1 John 3:4</b> - Sin is lawlessness." 
            },
            { 
                title: "9. Why Do We Die?", 
                instruction: "Death results from sin, not Jehovah’s original intent, as Romans 5:12 explains: 'Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin.' False worship’s soul immortality, rooted in Babylonian and Greek myths, contradicts this, but the Bible promises death’s end (1 Corinthians 15:26). Historically, Adam’s sin in 4026 B.C.E. (per Bible chronology) introduced mortality. Science confirms death as universal, unlike false claims of eternal consciousness. Jehovah’s purpose to eliminate death offers hope beyond pagan lies.", 
                description: "<b>History:</b> From Adam’s sin.", 
                example: "<b>Romans 5:12</b> - Death spread to all men.\n<b>Romans 6:23</b> - The wages sin pays is death.\n<b>1 Corinthians 15:26</b> - Death is to be brought to nothing." 
            },
            { 
                title: "10. What Is the Soul?", 
                instruction: "The soul is the living person—body and breath—not an immortal entity, as Genesis 2:7 states: 'Jehovah God went on to form the man... and the man became a living soul.' False worship’s spirit survival, from Egyptian and Hindu beliefs, clashes with Ezekiel 18:4: 'The soul who sins is the one who will die.' Historically, this truth shaped Israel’s rejection of afterlife myths. Science shows life ceases without breath or blood, aligning with Scripture, not paganism. This clarifies Jehovah’s resurrection hope over false immortality.", 
                description: "<b>Science:</b> Life ends without breath.", 
                example: "<b>Genesis 2:7</b> - The man became a living soul.\n<b>Ezekiel 18:4</b> - The soul who sins will die.\n<b>Ecclesiastes 9:10</b> - No work in the Grave." 
            },
            { 
                title: "11. What Is False Worship?", 
                instruction: "False worship defies Jehovah’s standards through idolatry and human traditions, as 1 John 5:21 warns: 'Guard yourselves from idols.' Unlike true worship, it includes pagan practices like statue veneration or polytheism, condemned in Exodus 20:4-5. Historically, Israel battled Canaanite idol worship, a struggle echoed today in religious syncretism. Science exposes idols as powerless—mere stone or wood—while the Bible’s God creates and sustains life. Rejecting false worship aligns us with Jehovah’s exclusive glory.", 
                description: "<b>Fact:</b> Defies God’s exclusivity.", 
                example: "<b>1 John 5:21</b> - Guard yourselves from idols.\n<b>Exodus 20:4-5</b> - You must not bow down to them.\n<b>Deuteronomy 4:39</b> - Jehovah is the true God." 
            },
            { 
                title: "12. What Is Prayer?", 
                instruction: "Prayer is personal communication with Jehovah, not rote chants or idol pleas, as Philippians 4:6 instructs: 'In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.' False worship uses repetitive formulas or intermediaries, like pagan priests, but Jesus taught direct access (John 16:23). Historically, faithful ones like Daniel prayed sincerely, not ritually. Science shows prayer’s calming effect, supporting its purpose in building faith. True prayer strengthens our bond with Jehovah, free of false traditions.", 
                description: "<b>Purpose:</b> Connection with Jehovah.", 
                example: "<b>Philippians 4:6</b> - Let your petitions be made known.\n<b>Matthew 6:7</b> - Do not say the same things over.\n<b>John 16:23</b> - Ask the Father in my name." 
            },
            { 
                title: "13. Why Have Faith?", 
                instruction: "Faith is confident trust in Jehovah’s promises, not blind superstition, as Hebrews 11:6 states: 'Without faith it is impossible to please God well.' False worship relies on luck or omens, like Babylonian astrology, but Bible faith rests on evidence—fulfilled prophecies and creation’s design (Romans 1:20). Historically, Noah’s faith saved his family, a pattern for us. Science marvels at the universe’s order, bolstering faith in a purposeful Creator. Faith in Jehovah’s Word offers hope beyond pagan uncertainties.", 
                description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Hope in truth.", 
                example: "<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - Without faith it is impossible.\n<b>Romans 10:17</b> - Faith follows the thing heard.\n<b>Hebrews 11:1</b> - Faith is the assured expectation." 
            },
            { 
                title: "14. What Is Baptism?", 
                instruction: "Baptism is a public symbol of dedication to Jehovah, not a ritual for infants, as Acts 2:38 commands: 'Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.' False worship sprinkles babies, a tradition from pagan rites, but the Bible requires conscious faith and full immersion (Matthew 3:16). Historically, early Christians baptized believers, not newborns. Science shows immersion’s symbolism—death to sin, new life—mirrors natural cycles. Baptism marks true worshipers committed to Jehovah.", 
                description: "<b>Fact:</b> Conscious decision.", 
                example: "<b>Acts 2:38</b> - Repent, and be baptized.\n<b>Matthew 3:16</b> - Jesus came up from the water.\n<b>Acts 8:36</b> - What prevents me from getting baptized?" 
            },
            { 
                title: "15. Why Obey God?", 
                instruction: "Obedience to Jehovah reflects love and brings blessings, as 1 John 5:3 explains: 'This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.' False worship follows human rules or lax morality, like pagan permissiveness, but the Bible ties obedience to life (Deuteronomy 11:27). Historically, Israel prospered when obedient, a lesson for today. Science links discipline to well-being, echoing Jehovah’s laws. Obeying Him ensures protection from false paths.", 
                description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Blessings from God.", 
                example: "<b>1 John 5:3</b> - This is what the love of God means.\n<b>Deuteronomy 11:27</b> - Blessing if you listen.\n<b>John 14:15</b> - If you love me, observe my commandments." 
            },
            { 
                title: "16. What Is Love?", 
                instruction: "Love mirrors Jehovah’s nature, a selfless action, not mere emotion, as 1 John 4:8 declares: 'God is love.' False worship distorts love into lust or ritual, like pagan fertility cults, but the Bible defines it through sacrifice—Jesus’ death (John 3:16). Historically, early Christians showed love by sharing all things (Acts 2:44-45). Science links love to health, reflecting Jehovah’s design. True love honors Him, not worldly desires.", 
                description: "<b>Fact:</b> Love is action.", 
                example: "<b>1 John 4:8</b> - God is love.\n<b>John 3:16</b> - God gave his only-begotten Son.\n<b>1 Corinthians 13:4</b> - Love is patient and kind." 
            },
            { 
                title: "17. Why Be Honest?", 
                instruction: "Honesty reflects Jehovah’s truthfulness, as Ephesians 4:25 urges: 'Speak truth each one of you with his neighbor.' False worship thrives on deceit, like pagan oracles’ vague lies, but the Bible demands integrity. Historically, honest dealings marked God’s servants, like Joseph in Egypt. Science shows trust builds societies, aligning with Jehovah’s principles. Honesty honors Him, rejecting falsehood’s corruption.", 
                description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Reflects God’s character.", 
                example: "<b>Ephesians 4:25</b> - Speak truth with his neighbor.\n<b>Proverbs 12:22</b> - Lying lips are detestable.\n<b>Psalm 15:2</b> - Speaking the truth in his heart." 
            },
            { 
                title: "18. What Is the Family?", 
                instruction: "The family is Jehovah’s arrangement for love and order, as Ephesians 5:23 states: 'A husband is head of his wife as the Christ is head of the congregation.' False worship distorts this with polygamy or matriarchy, like pagan goddess cults, but the Bible upholds one man, one woman (Genesis 2:24). Historically, the family unit sustained Israel’s faith. Science confirms stable families benefit society, reflecting Jehovah’s design. It’s a foundation for true worship.", 
                description: "<b>Purpose:</b> Love and order.", 
                example: "<b>Ephesians 5:23</b> - A husband is head of his wife.\n<b>Colossians 3:18-19</b> - Wives, be in subjection; husbands, love.\n<b>Proverbs 22:6</b> - Train a boy in the way." 
            },
            { 
                title: "19. Why Respect Authority?", 
                instruction: "Respecting authority maintains Jehovah’s order, as Romans 13:1 instructs: 'Let every person be in subjection to the superior authorities.' False worship rebels or deifies rulers, like Roman emperor worship, but the Bible balances obedience unless it defies God (Acts 5:29). Historically, Christians respected Caesar yet served Jehovah alone. Science shows order aids survival, mirroring divine wisdom. Respect aligns us with His will.", 
                description: "<b>Fact:</b> God-ordained order.", 
                example: "<b>Romans 13:1</b> - Be in subjection to the authorities.\n<b>Titus 3:1</b> - Be obedient to governments.\n<b>1 Peter 2:13</b> - Be submissive to every human creation." 
            },
            { 
                title: "20. What Is Money?", 
                instruction: "Money is a tool, not life’s goal, as 1 Timothy 6:10 warns: 'The love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things.' False worship idolizes wealth, like Mammon in pagan lore, but the Bible teaches contentment through faith (Hebrews 13:5). Historically, greed fueled empires’ falls, like Babylon’s. Science links materialism to stress, contrasting Jehovah’s peace. True security comes from Him, not riches.", 
                description: "<b>Fact:</b> Security from God.", 
                example: "<b>1 Timothy 6:10</b> - Love of money is a root.\n<b>Matthew 6:24</b> - You cannot slave for God and Riches.\n<b>Hebrews 13:5</b> - Be content with present things." 
            },
            { 
                title: "21. Why Work Hard?", 
                instruction: "Hard work honors Jehovah and supports others, as Ephesians 4:28 commands: 'Let the thief no longer steal, but let him do hard work.' False worship excuses laziness or exploits labor, like pagan slave systems, but the Bible values diligence (Proverbs 14:23). Historically, industrious Christians thrived, aiding the poor. Science ties work to purpose, reflecting Jehovah’s creation mandate. It’s worship through action.", 
                description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Helps others.", 
                example: "<b>Ephesians 4:28</b> - Let him do hard work.\n<b>Proverbs 14:23</b> - In hard work there is benefit.\n<b>2 Thessalonians 3:10</b> - If anyone does not work, neither let him eat." 
            },
            { 
                title: "22. What Is Wisdom?", 
                instruction: "Wisdom is applying Bible knowledge with reverence, as Proverbs 9:10 states: 'The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.' False worship seeks human philosophy, like Greek sophistry, but the Bible roots wisdom in Jehovah’s truth (James 3:17). Historically, Solomon’s wisdom came from God, not man. Science values knowledge, yet only Jehovah’s wisdom ensures life’s success. It guides us past pagan folly.", 
                description: "<b>Fact:</b> Starts with God.", 
                example: "<b>Proverbs 9:10</b> - Fear of Jehovah is wisdom.\n<b>James 3:17</b> - Wisdom from above is pure.\n<b>Psalm 111:10</b> - Fear of Jehovah is wisdom." 
            },
            { 
                title: "23. Why Be Humble?", 
                instruction: "Humility invites Jehovah’s favor, as James 4:6 promises: 'God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.' False worship exalts pride, like Babylonian kings’ boasts, but the Bible praises meekness (Micah 6:8). Historically, humble servants like Moses led God’s people. Science links humility to cooperation, mirroring Jehovah’s design. It fosters unity, not arrogance.", 
                description: "<b>Benefit:</b> God’s approval.", 
                example: "<b>James 4:6</b> - Gives kindness to the humble.\n<b>1 Peter 5:5</b> - Clothe yourselves with humility.\n<b>Micah 6:8</b> - Walk humbly with your God." 
            },
            { 
                title: "24. What Is Forgiveness?", 
                instruction: "Forgiveness reflects Jehovah’s mercy, as Ephesians 4:32 urges: 'Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another.' False worship clings to grudges or demands penance, like pagan blood rites, but the Bible teaches release through love. Historically, Jesus forgave even his executioners (Luke 23:34).
