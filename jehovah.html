                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Jehovah’s Name</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s name stands as the most significant and sacred identifier in all of Scripture, appearing over 7,000 times in the original Hebrew and Greek texts, a frequency that highlights its unparalleled importance to true worship and understanding the Creator. This divine name, represented by the Hebrew Tetragrammaton (YHWH), translates to “He Causes to Become,” a meaning that encapsulates Jehovah’s role as the purposeful and dynamic Creator who brings His will into reality. The Bible emphatically states, “I am Jehovah; that is my name; I give my glory to no one else, nor my praise to carved images” (Isaiah 42:8), making it clear that Jehovah alone is worthy of exclusive devotion and that He refuses to share His unique identity with any false god or idol. This name was first revealed to Moses around 1513 BCE at the burning bush, a dramatic encounter where Jehovah declared, “This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation” (Exodus 3:15). That revelation was not just a label but a promise tied to His eternal purpose—to transform the earth into a paradise populated by perfect humans, as He originally commanded Adam and Eve, saying, “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it” (Genesis 1:28). Jesus, Jehovah’s obedient Son, reinforced the sanctity of this name by teaching his followers to pray, “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified” (Matthew 6:9), and by affirming, “I have made your name known to them and will make it known, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them” (John 17:26). These statements underscore that knowing and honoring Jehovah’s name is not optional but essential to having a genuine relationship with Him and receiving His blessings.</p>
                        <p>Despite its importance, Satan, the great enemy of Jehovah, has waged a relentless campaign to erase this name from human awareness, a battle that traces back to Nimrod’s rebellion at Babel around 2269 BCE. At that time, rebellious humans gathered to build a tower and declared, “Come, let us build a city for ourselves and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves” (Genesis 11:4), an act of defiance against Jehovah’s authority that sought to elevate human pride over divine rule. This event set the stage for Satan’s ongoing efforts to obscure Jehovah’s identity, a strategy that gained traction centuries later when Jewish scribes, around 300 BCE, began avoiding pronouncing the divine name out of superstition, substituting it with titles like “Adonai” (Lord). This practice carried over into many Bible translations, where “LORD” in all capital letters replaced Jehovah’s name, a move that dilutes His personal identity and fosters confusion about who the true God is. Yet, Jehovah’s mighty acts throughout history shout His name louder than any human effort can silence it. For instance, around 1473 BCE, He parted the Red Sea, where “the waters were split apart” (Exodus 14:21), and then drowned Pharaoh’s pursuing army, as “the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen” (Exodus 14:27-28), proving that no power can stand against the One whose name is above all. Similarly, when Jehovah brought down the walls of Jericho around the same period, “the wall fell flat” (Joshua 6:20) at His command, a physical demonstration of His sovereignty that echoes the declaration, “Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God and the King forever” (Jeremiah 10:10). These events serve as undeniable evidence that Jehovah’s name represents His active presence and unmatched power in the universe.</p>
                        <h2>Historical Suppression</h2>
                        <p>The suppression of Jehovah’s name didn’t stop with ancient superstitions; it intensified as false religion grew in the early centuries of the Common Era, particularly by the third century CE, when apostate Christians began adopting pagan practices and titles that further distanced them from the true God. During this period, the influence of Greek philosophy and Roman traditions crept into the emerging church, leading to a deliberate effort to replace Jehovah’s name with generic terms like “God” or “Lord,” a shift that aligned with the blending of Christian teachings with pagan beliefs. However, Jehovah promised that this erasure would not last forever, as He foretold through the prophet Isaiah, “My people will know my name; therefore in that day they will know that I am the one speaking—here I am” (Isaiah 52:6). This prophecy is being fulfilled today as the truth about His name is restored, supported by historical evidence such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in 1947 but dated to around 200 BCE, which contain numerous instances of the Tetragrammaton in its original Hebrew form. These ancient manuscripts refute claims that Jehovah’s name is irrelevant or outdated, proving that it was cherished and used by His faithful servants long before false traditions took hold. Moreover, archaeological finds like the Moabite Stone, from around 840 BCE, mention “YHWH,” further confirming that Jehovah’s name was known and revered in ancient times, even among neighboring nations. This historical record stands as a testament to Jehovah’s enduring identity and His determination to be known by His people, just as He promised, “You will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you” (Jeremiah 29:12).</p>
                        <h2>Fate vs. Free Will</h2>
                        <p>One of Satan’s most insidious lies, propagated through ancient Babylonian astrology around 2000 BCE, is the concept of fate—an unchangeable destiny that strips humans of choice and accountability, locking them into a predetermined path they cannot escape. This belief, which spread through cultures like the Babylonians and later the Greeks, suggested that the stars or gods dictated every event, leaving no room for personal decision or divine mercy. In stark contrast, Jehovah’s Word dismantles this falsehood by affirming the gift of free will, as He told the Israelites, “See, I have set before you today life and good, and death and bad... therefore choose life so that you and your offspring may live” (Deuteronomy 30:19-20). This command makes it clear that humans are not puppets controlled by fate but beings created with the ability to choose their course, a freedom that reflects Jehovah’s justice and love. A powerful example of this principle is seen in His dealings with Nineveh around 830 BCE, when He sent Jonah to warn that wicked city of impending destruction, saying, “Only forty days more, and Nineveh will be overthrown” (Jonah 3:4). Yet, when the Ninevites repented, “God saw their works—that they had turned back from their evil ways—and he felt regret over the calamity that he had spoken of bringing on them, and he did not bring it” (Jonah 3:10). This dramatic turnaround proves that Jehovah responds to human choices, not a fixed destiny, and that He delights in mercy when people turn to Him, as He says, “I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked one should turn back from his way and live” (Ezekiel 33:11). Thus, the lie of fate is exposed as a tool of Satan to rob humans of hope, while Jehovah’s truth offers freedom and life through the exercise of free will in harmony with His will.</p>

            <!-- Jehovah’s Sovereignty -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Jehovah’s Sovereignty</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s sovereignty is the supreme authority He holds as the Creator and Ruler of the universe, a right He alone possesses, as the Bible declares, “Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over everything” (Psalm 103:19). This sovereignty was challenged in Eden around 4026 BCE, when Satan deceived Eve, implying Jehovah’s rule was restrictive, saying, “Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden?” (Genesis 3:1). This rebellion escalated at Babel around 2269 BCE, where humans sought to defy Jehovah’s authority, declaring, “Let us make a celebrated name for ourselves” (Genesis 11:4). Jehovah’s response was swift—He confused their languages and scattered them, proving “there is no one like me” (Isaiah 46:9). Throughout history, He has vindicated His sovereignty through mighty acts, such as delivering Israel from Egypt around 1513 BCE, when He declared, “I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt. I am Jehovah” (Exodus 12:12). His parting of the Red Sea, where “the waters were split apart” (Exodus 14:21), and the destruction of Pharaoh’s army, “not one of them remained” (Exodus 14:28), demonstrated that no power can usurp His rule. Jesus upheld this sovereignty, teaching, “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service” (Matthew 4:10), a principle that guides true worshipers to honor Jehovah’s rightful place as King.</p>
                        <p>Satan’s challenge continues today, as human governments and false religions defy Jehovah’s authority, but His Word assures their end, for “the kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” (Revelation 11:15). The prophecy of Daniel’s statue, struck by “the stone” of God’s Kingdom (Daniel 2:44), foretells the collapse of all human rule, a process that began in 1914 when Christ was enthroned. Jehovah’s sovereignty is not just power but justice and love, as He promises, “My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please” (Isaiah 46:10), ensuring a paradise earth where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Vindication Through History</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah has consistently vindicated His sovereignty against challengers. Around 1473 BCE, He crushed Korah’s rebellion against Moses’ authority, when “the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up” (Numbers 16:32), proving His appointed leadership is inviolable. In 539 BCE, He toppled Babylon, as “the kingdom was given to the Medes and Persians” (Daniel 5:28), fulfilling His word through Isaiah, who named Cyrus 200 years earlier (Isaiah 44:28). These acts show Jehovah’s control over history, as “he changes times and seasons; he removes kings and sets up kings” (Daniel 2:21). Archaeological evidence, like the Cyrus Cylinder from 539 BCE, confirms His precise fulfillment, reinforcing that “Jehovah of armies has sworn: ‘As I have thought, so it will happen’” (Isaiah 14:24).</p>
                        <h2>Future Triumph</h2>
                        <p>At Armageddon, Jehovah’s sovereignty will be fully vindicated, as “he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God” (Revelation 19:15), destroying all who oppose Him, for “the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war” but are defeated (Revelation 19:19-21). This final act will usher in a world where “every knee will bend to me” (Isaiah 45:23), and His name will be universally known, fulfilling “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). True worshipers align with this now, proclaiming His rule, as “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over everything.” —Psalm 103:19</p>

            <!-- Jehovah’s Attributes -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Jehovah’s Attributes</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s attributes—love, justice, wisdom, and power—define His character and set Him apart as the only true God, as the Bible states, “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth” (Exodus 34:6). His love is evident in creating humans for life, saying, “Be fruitful and become many” (Genesis 1:28), and providing the ransom through Jesus, “for God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son” (John 3:16). His justice shines in His impartiality, “there is no injustice with Jehovah our God, nor partiality” (2 Chronicles 19:7), seen when He judged Israel’s idolatry, “Jehovah’s anger blazed against them” (Numbers 25:3). His wisdom crafted the universe, “how many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom” (Psalm 104:24), from DNA’s complexity to earth’s ecosystems. His power, “everlasting strength” (Isaiah 26:4), parted the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21) and will resurrect billions, as “all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out” (John 5:28-29). These attributes demand worship, as “you must love Jehovah your God with all your heart” (Deuteronomy 6:5).</p>
                        <p>Satan distorts these attributes, painting Jehovah as cruel or weak, but His actions refute this. When He spared Nineveh after their repentance, “he did not bring the calamity” (Jonah 3:10), His mercy shone. His destruction of Sodom, “sulfur and fire from Jehovah” (Genesis 19:24), upheld justice. True worshipers reflect His qualities, “be imitators of God, as beloved children” (Ephesians 5:1), living by His standards.</p>
                        <h2>Balancing Attributes</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah perfectly balances His attributes, never compromising one for another. His love does not excuse sin, as “he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished” (Nahum 1:3), shown when He struck Uzziah with leprosy for pride (2 Chronicles 26:19). His justice offers mercy, “return to me, and I will return to you” (Zechariah 1:3), as when He forgave David’s repentance, “Jehovah has pardoned your sin” (2 Samuel 12:13). His wisdom ensures His purpose, “my word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11), and His power guarantees it, “nothing is too extraordinary for Jehovah” (Genesis 18:14).</p>
                        <h2>Human Reflection</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah calls His servants to mirror His attributes, “be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16). Love drives preaching, “love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:39); justice guides fairness, “do not pervert justice” (Deuteronomy 16:19); wisdom shapes decisions, “the wisdom from above is first of all pure” (James 3:17); and power comes from His spirit, “you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you” (Acts 1:8). By imitating Jehovah, “we might become imitators of him” (1 Corinthians 11:1), true worshipers honor His name.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.” —Exodus 34:6</p>

            <!-- Jehovah’s Purpose -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Jehovah’s Purpose</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s purpose is to restore the earth to a paradise where righteous humans live forever, fulfilling His original intent in Eden, “he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18). He tasked Adam and Eve, “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it” (Genesis 1:28), a plan disrupted by sin but not abandoned, as “my purpose will stand” (Isaiah 46:10). Through Jesus’ ransom, “a ransom in exchange for many” (Matthew 20:28), Jehovah ensures “the righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29). His Kingdom, established in 1914, will “crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44), transforming earth into a world where “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24). This purpose drives history, from the Flood, “every living thing was wiped out” (Genesis 7:23), to Israel’s deliverance, “I am Jehovah your God” (Exodus 6:7), proving His unwavering commitment. True worshipers align with this, praying, “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10), and preaching, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p>Satan opposes this purpose, promoting rebellion and lies, but Jehovah’s victories—Babylon’s fall in 539 BCE, “the kingdom was given to the Medes and Persians” (Daniel 5:28)—show his defeat is certain, “the Devil was hurled into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:10). The earth’s design, with its perfect ecosystems, confirms Jehovah’s intent, “he did not create it simply for nothing” (Isaiah 45:18).</p>
                        <h2>Steps to Fulfillment</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s purpose unfolds through His covenants: the Abrahamic, “all the families of the ground will be blessed by means of you” (Genesis 12:3); the Mosaic, “you will be my special possession” (Exodus 19:5); and the new covenant, “by virtue of my blood” (Luke 22:20). Each step advances His plan, culminating in Christ’s rule, “he must rule as king” (1 Corinthians 15:25). The resurrection, “both the righteous and the unrighteous” (Acts 24:15), ensures all can benefit, as “death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4).</p>
                        <h2>Human Role</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah invites humans to share in His purpose, “seek Jehovah while he may be found” (Isaiah 55:6), by obeying His laws, “keep my commandments and live” (Proverbs 7:2), and preaching His Kingdom, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). When Israel obeyed, “Jehovah blessed them” (Deuteronomy 28:2); when they rebelled, “I disciplined them” (Hosea 10:10). Today, true worshipers fulfill this role, “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14), ensuring His purpose triumphs.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.” —Isaiah 46:10</p>

            <!-- Jehovah’s Worship -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Jehovah’s Worship</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Worshiping Jehovah is the highest calling, requiring exclusive devotion, as He commands, “You must not have any other gods besides me” (Exodus 20:3). Jesus clarified, “You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth” (John 4:24), a lifestyle of obedience, not ritual, as “the one doing the will of my Father” enters the Kingdom (Matthew 7:21). This worship began in Eden, where Adam was to “cultivate and take care of it” (Genesis 2:15), and continued through faithful ones like Abel, whose offering “Jehovah looked with favor” (Genesis 4:4). Jehovah demands purity, striking Nadab and Abihu for “unauthorized fire” (Leviticus 10:1-2), and unity, “one faith, one baptism” (Ephesians 4:5). His worshipers preach globally, “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14), a work unbroken since Jesus’ day, “teaching and proclaiming the good news” (Luke 8:1). Satan’s false religions, “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5), cannot rival this, as Jehovah’s people are “no part of the world” (John 17:16).</p>
                        <p>Persecution tests this worship, as when Nero burned Christians in 64 CE, yet “they rejoiced because they had been counted worthy” (Acts 5:41). Daniel faced lions for praying, “he kept praying just as he had been doing” (Daniel 6:10), and Jehovah saved him, “no injury was found on him” (Daniel 6:23). True worshipers today stand firm, “endure to the end” (Matthew 24:13), knowing “those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30).</p>
                        <h2>Elements of Worship</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s worship includes prayer, “call upon me in the day of distress” (Psalm 50:15); study, “this book of the Law should not depart from your mouth” (Joshua 1:8); and preaching, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). Meetings unite His people, “not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25), as in the first century, “they continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42). Each act honors Jehovah, “offer to God a sacrifice of praise” (Hebrews 13:15).</p>
                        <h2>Opposition Overcome</h2>
                        <p>Satan opposes Jehovah’s worship, “the god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah protects His servants, as when He freed Peter from prison, “the angel struck Peter on the side” (Acts 12:7). History shows His deliverance—Israel’s exodus, “Jehovah brought them out” (Exodus 12:51)—and prophecy assures victory, “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17). True worshipers persist, “we must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth.” —John 4:24</p>

            <!-- Jehovah’s Justice -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Jehovah’s Justice</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s justice is perfect, reflecting His nature as “a God of faithfulness, without injustice” (Deuteronomy 32:4). He judges impartially, “Jehovah will by no means leave the guilty unpunished” (Nahum 1:3), yet offers mercy, “he does not desire anyone to be destroyed” (2 Peter 3:9). His justice was evident in the Flood around 2370 BCE, “every living thing was wiped out” (Genesis 7:23), for “the earth was filled with violence” (Genesis 6:11). He destroyed Sodom, “sulfur and fire from Jehovah” (Genesis 19:24), for “their sin has become very grave” (Genesis 18:20). Yet, He spared Rahab for her faith, “Jehovah your God is God” (Joshua 2:11), showing “he will render to each one according to his works” (Romans 2:6). His law to Israel, “you must not pervert justice” (Deuteronomy 16:19), set a standard, and His discipline, “I disciplined them to the proper degree” (Jeremiah 30:11), corrects lovingly. True worshipers trust His justice, “Jehovah is a God of justice” (Isaiah 30:18).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s world mocks justice, but Jehovah’s judgments prevail, as when He struck 185,000 Assyrians, “they were all dead bodies” (2 Kings 19:35), defending His people. At Armageddon, “the great day of Jehovah” (Zephaniah 1:14), His justice will end wickedness, “the wicked will be no more” (Psalm 37:10), fulfilling His promise, “righteousness will dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Mercy in Judgment</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s justice includes mercy, “slow to anger and abundant in loyal love” (Exodus 34:6). He forgave Nineveh, “he did not bring the calamity” (Jonah 3:10), and David, “Jehovah has pardoned your sin” (2 Samuel 12:13), when they repented. His ransom through Jesus, “a propitiatory sacrifice” (1 John 2:2), extends mercy, “everlasting life to those who obey him” (Hebrews 5:9). Yet, mercy has limits, “he will not always shield the guilty” (Exodus 34:7), as Ananias learned, “you have lied to God” (Acts 5:4-5).</p>
                        <h2>Application Today</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah calls His people to reflect His justice, “do not pervert justice or show partiality” (Deuteronomy 16:19), and to love mercy, “love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:39). When Israel failed, “Jehovah’s anger blazed” (2 Kings 17:18); today, true worshipers uphold fairness, “the one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), preparing for “a new earth” where “justice is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s mercy is His compassionate willingness to forgive and restore, as He declares, “I am compassionate” (Exodus 22:27), and “I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked” (Ezekiel 33:11). His mercy shone when He spared Israel despite their rebellion, “for the sake of my name I will hold back my anger” (Isaiah 48:9), and when He sent Jesus, “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son” (John 3:16). Around 1513 BCE, after the golden calf, “Jehovah forgave the people” (Exodus 34:9-10), showing His “abundant loyal love” (Psalm 86:5). He saved Rahab, “you have shown loyal love” (Joshua 2:12-14), and Manasseh, “he humbled himself greatly” (2 Chronicles 33:12-13), proving “his mercy endures forever” (Psalm 136:1). True worshipers seek this mercy, “return to Jehovah your God” (Hosea 14:1), and share it, “become merciful, just as your Father is merciful” (Luke 6:36).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s lies paint Jehovah as merciless, but His actions refute this—Nineveh’s reprieve, “he felt regret over the calamity” (Jonah 3:10), and the resurrection hope, “all those in the memorial tombs” (John 5:28-29), show His heart. False religion’s hellfire doctrine denies this, but Jehovah’s mercy ensures “death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4).</p>
                        <h2>Conditions for Mercy</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s mercy requires repentance, “let the wicked leave his way” (Isaiah 55:7), as seen when He spared David, “I have sinned greatly” (2 Samuel 12:13). Unrepentant ones, like Achan, faced death, “Jehovah’s anger blazed” (Joshua 7:1). His mercy extends through Jesus, “a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 2:2), but demands faith, “the one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36).</p>
                        <h2>Extending Mercy</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah commands His people to show mercy, “you must love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18), as the Samaritan did, “he showed mercy to him” (Luke 10:37). Forgiving others, “forgive men their trespasses” (Matthew 6:14), and preaching, “make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), reflect His mercy, preparing for a world where “mercy triumphs over judgment” (James 2:13).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Jehovah’s Promises</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s promises are unbreakable, as “not one word of all his good promise failed” (1 Kings 8:56). He vowed a paradise earth, “the righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29), a hope from Eden, “he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18). His covenant with Abraham, “all the families of the ground will be blessed” (Genesis 12:3), was fulfilled through Jesus, “a ransom in exchange for many” (Matthew 20:28). He promised Israel deliverance, “I will take you as my people” (Exodus 6:7), realized at the Red Sea, “Jehovah saved Israel” (Exodus 14:30). His prophecy of Cyrus, “he is my shepherd” (Isaiah 44:28), freed Israel in 537 BCE, “the word of Jehovah was fulfilled” (Ezra 1:1). Today, His Kingdom promise, “it will crush all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44), advances since 1914, urging true worshipers to trust, “my word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11).</p>
                        <p>Satan challenges these promises, but Jehovah’s record stands—Tyre’s ruin, “a bare rock” (Ezekiel 26:4), and Babylon’s fall, “it will never be inhabited” (Isaiah 13:20), prove His word. False religion denies His promises, but “heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away” (Matthew 24:35).</p>
                        <h2>Historical Fulfillment</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s promises shaped history: Noah’s ark, “Jehovah shut the door” (Genesis 7:16), saved eight; Joshua’s conquest, “not one word failed” (Joshua 21:45), gave Israel Canaan; and Jerusalem’s fall, “the land will be desolate” (Jeremiah 25:11), lasted 70 years. The Dead Sea Scrolls, dated to 200 BCE, confirm His preserved Word, “the word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <h2>Future Assurance</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s future promises include Armageddon, “the wicked will be no more” (Psalm 37:10), and resurrection, “those asleep in the dust will wake up” (Daniel 12:2). His Kingdom will bring “a new heavens and a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where “death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4). True worshipers act now, “pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), confident in “Jehovah of armies” (Isaiah 44:6).</p>
