                        <p>The canon of the Bible began with the Hebrew Scriptures, starting around 1513 BCE when Moses, guided by Jehovah’s spirit, wrote the first five books—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This date is inferred from biblical chronology and paleographic analysis of inscriptions like the Gezer Calendar (10th century BCE). Jehovah Himself set the standard, writing the Ten Commandments on stone tablets (Exodus 31:18) and instructing Moses to record His laws (Exodus 34:27). These writings, the Pentateuch, established God’s covenant with Israel, showing inspiration through their harmony and fulfilled prophecy, such as the 70-year exile foretold in Jeremiah 29:10 and completed by 537 BCE.</p>
                        <p>Their divine origin is evident in internal consistency and prophetic accuracy, with scribes ensuring precision under divine guidance, free from uninspired additions. Scrolls were placed beside the ark (Deuteronomy 31:26) as a witness. Archaeological finds like the Silver Scrolls (carbon-14 dated to 600 BCE) with “YHWH” blessings confirm their authenticity. This foundation, fulfilling “the saying of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25), began a trustworthy canon.</p>
