                title: "1. Why Study the Bible?", 
                instruction: "The Bible stands as Jehovah’s inspired Word, a divine gift distinct from human philosophies or religious texts rooted in false worship, such as pagan myths or materialistic ideologies. It reveals God’s will and purpose for humanity, offering guidance for life’s challenges, as affirmed by 2 Timothy 3:16: 'All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.' Historically, its preservation through centuries—despite attempts to suppress it—demonstrates divine protection. Scientifically, its references, like the earth’s suspension (Job 26:7), align with later discoveries, proving its reliability. Studying it equips us to reject false teachings, like idol worship or soul immortality, and fosters a relationship with Jehovah based on truth.", 
                description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Wisdom and protection from false teachings.", 
                example: "<b>2 Timothy 3:16</b> - All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.\n<b>Joshua 1:8</b> - This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth, and you must read it in an undertone day and night, in order to act wisely and have success.\n<b>Psalm 119:105</b> - Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light for my path.\n<b>John 17:17</b> - Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.\n<b>Proverbs 2:6</b> - For Jehovah himself gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and discernment.\n<b>Hebrews 4:12</b> - For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword." 
            },
            { 
                title: "2. Who Wrote the Bible?", 
                instruction: "The Bible was penned by over 40 human writers—kings, prophets, fishermen—spanning 1,600 years, yet its unity stems from Jehovah’s holy spirit, as 2 Peter 1:21 states: 'Men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.' Unlike pagan texts filled with contradictory myths, its consistent message across centuries proves divine authorship. Historically, its composition began with Moses around 1513 B.C.E. and concluded with John’s writings around 98 C.E., surviving persecution and translation into thousands of languages. Science supports its accuracy, such as the hydrologic cycle in Job 36:27-28, predating modern understanding. This refutes false worship’s claim of human origin, affirming Jehovah as its true Author.", 
                description: "<b>History:</b> Unified over 1,600 years.", 
                example: "<b>2 Peter 1:21</b> - For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.\n<b>2 Timothy 3:16</b> - All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial.\n<b>Isaiah 40:8</b> - The word of our God endures forever.\n<b>Psalm 45:1</b> - My tongue is the stylus of a skilled copyist.\n<b>Jeremiah 1:9</b> - Then Jehovah stretched out his hand and touched my mouth, and Jehovah said to me: 'Here I have put my words in your mouth.'\n<b>Revelation 1:1</b> - A revelation by Jesus Christ, which God gave him." 
            },
            { 
                title: "3. Is the Bible Scientifically Accurate?", 
                instruction: "The Bible’s scientific accuracy shines through statements made long before human discovery, such as Job 26:7: 'He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.' This aligns with the earth’s suspension in space, a fact unknown in ancient times. Unlike false worship’s flat-earth myths or Babylonian cosmologies, Isaiah 40:22 describes Jehovah as 'the One who dwells above the circle of the earth,' hinting at its spherical shape. Historically, its sanitation laws (Leviticus 11-15) predate germ theory, saving lives. These facts dismantle claims of inaccuracy, proving the Bible’s divine origin and its superiority over pagan falsehoods.", 
                description: "<b>Science:</b> Earth’s shape and suspension.", 
                example: "<b>Job 26:7</b> - He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.\n<b>Isaiah 40:22</b> - It is he who sits above the circle of the earth.\n<b>Job 36:27-28</b> - For he draws up the drops of water; they filter as rain for his mist.\n<b>Leviticus 13:46</b> - All the days that the disease is upon him he will be unclean; he must dwell isolated.\n<b>Ecclesiastes 1:7</b> - All the streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is not full.\n<b>Psalm 104:6</b> - You covered it with deep waters as with a garment." 
            },
            { 
                title: "4. What Is God’s Name?", 
                instruction: "Jehovah, God’s personal name, appears over 7,000 times in the original texts, as Psalm 83:18 declares: 'You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.' False worship obscures this name with titles like 'Lord,' a practice rooted in superstition and tradition, not Scripture. Historically, the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) was revered by Israel, yet removed by later scribes influenced by pagan customs. Science offers no contradiction, but the Bible’s consistent use across millennia confirms its authenticity. Knowing Jehovah’s name sets true worship apart from the nameless deities of false religion.", 
                description: "<b>Origin:</b> YHWH, often removed.", 
                example: "<b>Psalm 83:18</b> - May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.\n<b>Exodus 3:15</b> - Jehovah, the God of your forefathers... this is my name forever.\n<b>Isaiah 42:8</b> - I am Jehovah. That is my name; I give my glory to no one else.\n<b>Exodus 6:3</b> - I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but with regard to my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them.\n<b>Matthew 6:9</b> - You must pray, then, this way: 'Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.'\n<b>Joel 2:32</b> - Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved." 
            },
            { 
                title: "5. Who Is Jesus Christ?", 
                instruction: "Jesus Christ is Jehovah’s firstborn Son, not God Almighty, as Colossians 1:15 states: 'He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.' False worship, like the Trinity doctrine from pagan triads, equates him with Jehovah, but Scripture distinguishes them. Historically, Jesus’ role as Messiah was foretold (Isaiah 9:6) and fulfilled in 29 C.E., initiating Christianity. Science aligns with his miracles, like healing, as acts of divine power, not myth. He’s the ransom and future King, refuting false claims of co-equality and affirming Jehovah’s supremacy in true worship.", 
                description: "<b>Role:</b> Son and Savior.", 
                example: "<b>Colossians 1:15</b> - He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.\n<b>John 3:16</b> - For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son.\n<b>1 Timothy 2:5</b> - For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus.\n<b>John 14:28</b> - The Father is greater than I am.\n<b>Matthew 20:28</b> - The Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom.\n<b>Revelation 19:16</b> - He has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords." 
            },
            { 
                title: "6. What Is the Holy Spirit?", 
                instruction: "The holy spirit is Jehovah’s active force, not a person, as Genesis 1:2 reveals: 'God’s active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.' False worship’s Trinity portrays it as a deity, borrowing from pagan trios like Egypt’s Osiris-Isis-Horus, but the Bible shows it as God’s power at work. Historically, it inspired prophets and empowered Jesus’ miracles (Luke 4:1). Scientifically, its effects—like creation’s order—suggest a purposeful force, not a random entity. Understanding this counters false teachings and honors Jehovah’s true nature.", 
                description: "<b>Use:</b> God’s power.", 
                example: "<b>Genesis 1:2</b> - God’s active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.\n<b>Job 26:13</b> - By his spirit the heavens were made beautiful.\n<b>Luke 4:1</b> - Then Jesus, full of holy spirit, turned away from the Jordan.\n<b>Psalm 104:30</b> - You send out your spirit, and they are created.\n<b>Acts 1:8</b> - You will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you.\n<b>Matthew 3:16</b> - He saw God’s spirit descending like a dove." 
            },
            { 
                title: "7. Why Did God Create the Earth?", 
                instruction: "Jehovah created the earth as a permanent home for humanity, as Isaiah 45:18 affirms: 'He is the One who formed the earth... who firmly established it, who did not create it simply for nothing, but formed it to be inhabited.' False worship teaches a temporary earth or soul ascension, echoing pagan afterlife myths, but the Bible promises an eternal paradise. Historically, Genesis records this purpose from creation’s start. Science supports an earth designed for life—its water, air, and ecosystems—refuting chance. This truth inspires hope in Jehovah’s original plan.", 
                description: "<b>Purpose:</b> A lasting home.", 
                example: "<b>Psalm 104:5</b> - He has established the earth on its foundations; it will not be moved from its place forever and ever.\n<b>Isaiah 45:18</b> - He is the One who formed the earth... who did not create it simply for nothing, but formed it to be inhabited.\n<b>Genesis 1:28</b> - God blessed them and God said to them: 'Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it.'\n<b>Psalm 115:16</b> - As for the heavens, they belong to Jehovah, but the earth he has given to the sons of men.\n<b>Matthew 5:5</b> - Happy are the mild-tempered, for they will inherit the earth.\n<b>Revelation 21:1</b> - I saw a new heaven and a new earth." 
            },
            { 
                title: "8. What Is Sin?", 
                instruction: "Sin is any act or thought that misses Jehovah’s perfect standards, inherited from Adam, as Romans 3:23 states: 'All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.' False worship minimizes sin with rituals or excuses, like pagan sacrifices to appease gods, but the Bible calls it rebellion against Jehovah. Historically, sin entered through Adam’s disobedience in Eden (Genesis 3). Science shows human imperfection—disease and death—as sin’s effects, not evolution’s design. Recognizing sin’s gravity drives us to seek Jehovah’s forgiveness, not human solutions.", 
                description: "<b>Origin:</b> Rebellion against God.", 
                example: "<b>Romans 3:23</b> - For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\n<b>Genesis 3:6</b> - So she took some of its fruit and ate it; she also gave some to her husband.\n<b>1 John 3:4</b> - Everyone who practices sin is also practicing lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.\n<b>James 4:17</b> - Therefore, if someone knows how to do what is right and yet does not do it, it is a sin for him.\n<b>Psalm 51:5</b> - Look! I was born guilty of error, and my mother conceived me in sin.\n<b>Romans 5:12</b> - Through one man sin entered into the world." 
            },
            { 
                title: "9. Why Do We Die?", 
                instruction: "Death results from sin, not Jehovah’s original intent, as Romans 5:12 explains: 'Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin.' False worship’s soul immortality, rooted in Babylonian and Greek myths, contradicts this, but the Bible promises death’s end (1 Corinthians 15:26). Historically, Adam’s sin in 4026 B.C.E. (per Bible chronology) introduced mortality. Science confirms death as universal, unlike false claims of eternal consciousness. Jehovah’s purpose to eliminate death offers hope beyond pagan lies.", 
                description: "<b>History:</b> From Adam’s sin.", 
                example: "<b>Romans 5:12</b> - That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned.\n<b>Romans 6:23</b> - For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life.\n<b>1 Corinthians 15:26</b> - And the last enemy, death, is to be brought to nothing.\n<b>Genesis 2:17</b> - But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.\n<b>Ecclesiastes 9:5</b> - For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all.\n<b>Revelation 21:4</b> - Death will be no more." 
            },
            { 
                title: "10. What Is the Soul?", 
                instruction: "The soul is the living person—body and breath—not an immortal entity, as Genesis 2:7 states: 'Jehovah God went on to form the man... and the man became a living soul.' False worship’s spirit survival, from Egyptian and Hindu beliefs, clashes with Ezekiel 18:4: 'The soul who sins is the one who will die.' Historically, this truth shaped Israel’s rejection of afterlife myths. Science shows life ceases without breath or blood, aligning with Scripture, not paganism. This clarifies Jehovah’s resurrection hope over false immortality.", 
                description: "<b>Science:</b> Life ends without breath.", 
                example: "<b>Genesis 2:7</b> - And Jehovah God went on to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living soul.\n<b>Ezekiel 18:4</b> - Look! All the souls—to me they belong... the soul who sins is the one who will die.\n<b>Ecclesiastes 9:10</b> - There is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave, where you are going.\n<b>Leviticus 17:11</b> - For the life of the flesh is in the blood.\n<b>Psalm 146:4</b> - His spirit goes out, he returns to the ground; on that very day his thoughts perish.\n<b>Acts 3:23</b> - Indeed, anyone who does not listen to that Prophet will be completely destroyed from among the people." 
            },
            { 
                title: "11. What Is False Worship?", 
                instruction: "False worship defies Jehovah’s standards through idolatry and human traditions, as 1 John 5:21 warns: 'Guard yourselves from idols.' Unlike true worship, it includes pagan practices like statue veneration or polytheism, condemned in Exodus 20:4-5. Historically, Israel battled Canaanite idol worship, a struggle echoed today in religious syncretism. Science exposes idols as powerless—mere stone or wood—while the Bible’s God creates and sustains life. Rejecting false worship aligns us with Jehovah’s exclusive glory.", 
                description: "<b>Fact:</b> Defies God’s exclusivity.", 
                example: "<b>1 John 5:21</b> - Little children, guard yourselves from idols.\n<b>Exodus 20:4-5</b> - You must not make for yourself a carved image... you must not bow down to them nor be enticed to serve them.\n<b>Deuteronomy 4:39</b> - Know, therefore, on this day and take it to heart that Jehovah is the true God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.\n<b>Isaiah 44:9</b> - The makers of idols are all of them senseless.\n<b>Psalm 115:4-8</b> - Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands.\n<b>1 Corinthians 10:14</b> - Therefore, my beloved ones, flee from idolatry." 
            },
            { 
                title: "12. What Is Prayer?", 
                instruction: "Prayer is personal communication with Jehovah, not rote chants or idol pleas, as Philippians 4:6 instructs: 'In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.' False worship uses repetitive formulas or intermediaries, like pagan priests, but Jesus taught direct access (John 16:23). Historically, faithful ones like Daniel prayed sincerely, not ritually. Science shows prayer’s calming effect, supporting its purpose in building faith. True prayer strengthens our bond with Jehovah, free of false traditions.", 
                description: "<b>Purpose:</b> Connection with Jehovah.", 
                example: "<b>Philippians 4:6</b> - Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.\n<b>Matthew 6:7</b> - When praying, do not say the same things over and over again as the people of the nations do.\n<b>John 16:23</b> - If you ask the Father for anything, he will give it to you in my name.\n<b>Psalm 65:2</b> - O Hearer of prayer, to you people of all sorts will come.\n<b>1 Thessalonians 5:17</b> - Pray constantly.\n<b>Daniel 6:10</b> - He continued to get down on his knees three times a day to pray and offer praise before his God." 
            },
            { 
                title: "13. Why Have Faith?", 
                instruction: "Faith is confident trust in Jehovah’s promises, not blind superstition, as Hebrews 11:6 states: 'Without faith it is impossible to please God well.' False worship relies on luck or omens, like Babylonian astrology, but Bible faith rests on evidence—fulfilled prophecies and creation’s design (Romans 2:20). Historically, Noah’s faith saved his family, a pattern for us. Science marvels at the universe’s order, bolstering faith in a purposeful Creator.

Science traces its pagan roots, affirming Jehovah’s truth.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Historical accuracy.", 
        example: "<b>Acts 2:23</b> - Nailed to the stake.\n<b>Galatians 3:13</b> - Hung on a stake.\n<b>Deuteronomy 21:23</b> - Hung on a tree." 
    },
    { 
        title: "90. What Is the Day of Jehovah?", 
        instruction: "The Day of Jehovah is His judgment on wickedness, as Joel 2:11 warns: 'The day of Jehovah is great and very awe-inspiring.' False worship fears random doom, like pagan end-times, but the Bible targets evil (2 Peter 3:10). Historically, past judgments like Sodom’s prefigure it. Science notes earth’s fragility, but Jehovah’s day renews it.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> God’s intervention.", 
        example: "<b>Joel 2:11</b> - Great and fear-inspiring day.\n<b>Zephaniah 1:14</b> - Day of Jehovah is near.\n<b>2 Peter 3:10</b> - Day will come as a thief." 
    },
    { 
        title: "91. Why No Pagan Holidays?", 
        instruction: "Pagan holidays defy Jehovah, as Jeremiah 10:2 commands: 'Do not learn the way of the nations.' False worship blends them with truth, like Christmas from Saturnalia, but the Bible rejects such customs (2 Corinthians 6:17). Historically, faithful ones shunned these post-apostles. Science traces their origins, not Jehovah’s will.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Unscriptural origins.", 
        example: "<b>Jeremiah 10:2</b> - Do not learn the way.\n<b>2 Corinthians 6:17</b> - Separate yourselves.\n<b>Colossians 2:8</b> - Traditions of men." 
    },
    { 
        title: "92. What Is the Final Test?", 
        instruction: "The final test follows Satan’s release after 1,000 years, as Revelation 20:3 states: 'He should be released for a little while.' False worship expects endless trials, like pagan cycles, but the Bible proves loyalty once (Revelation 20:7-8). Historically, tests like Job’s foreshadow it. Science can’t foresee it, but Jehovah’s plan ensures justice.", 
        description: "<b>Future:</b> After 1,000 years.", 
        example: "<b>Revelation 20:3</b> - Released for a little while.\n<b>Revelation 20:7-8</b> - Satan released to mislead.\n<b>1 Corinthians 15:24</b> - End when he hands over Kingdom." 
    },
    { 
        title: "93. Why No Reincarnation?", 
        instruction: "Reincarnation is false, as Hebrews 9:27 states: 'It is reserved for men to die once for all time.' False worship, like Hindu samsara, recycles souls, but the Bible promises resurrection (John 5:28-29). Historically, Israel rejected such myths. Science shows life’s uniqueness, aligning with Jehovah’s one-death truth.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> One life, then judgment.", 
        example: "<b>Hebrews 9:27</b> - Appointed to die once.\n<b>John 5:28-29</b> - Tombs will come out.\n<b>Ecclesiastes 9:5</b> - Dead know nothing." 
    },
    { 
        title: "94. What Is the Millennium?", 
        instruction: "The Millennium is Christ’s 1,000-year reign to restore earth, as Revelation 20:4 states: 'They came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for 1,000 years.' False worship envisions chaos, like pagan end-times, but the Bible promises peace (Isaiah 65:20). Historically, it follows Armageddon. Science sees earth’s potential, reflecting Jehovah’s renewal.", 
        description: "<b>Future:</b> Peace for 1,000 years.", 
        example: "<b>Revelation 20:4</b> - Ruled for 1,000 years.\n<b>Isaiah 65:20</b> - No more infant dying.\n<b>Revelation 20:6</b> - Priests for 1,000 years." 
    },
    { 
        title: "95. Why No Materialism?", 
        instruction: "Materialism distracts from Jehovah, as Matthew 6:24 warns: 'You cannot slave for God and for Riches.' False worship idolizes wealth, like Mammon cults, but the Bible teaches spiritual riches (1 Timothy 6:10). Historically, greed ruined nations like Babylon. Science links it to misery, proving Jehovah’s way brings true contentment.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Focus on spiritual riches.", 
        example: "<b>Matthew 6:24</b> - Cannot slave for God and Riches.\n<b>1 Timothy 6:10</b> - Love of money a root.\n<b>Luke 12:34</b> - Where your treasure is." 
    },
    { 
        title: "96. What Is the Second Death?", 
        instruction: "The second death is eternal destruction, as Revelation 20:14 states: 'This means the second death, the lake of fire.' False worship fears endless torment, like pagan hells, but the Bible ends rebellion permanently (Matthew 10:28). Historically, it’s post-Millennium judgment. Science can’t undo death, but Jehovah’s justice prevails.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Final end.", 
        example: "<b>Revelation 20:14</b> - Second death, the lake of fire.\n<b>Revelation 21:8</b> - Their portion in the lake.\n<b>Matthew 10:28</b> - Destroy both soul and body." 
    },
    { 
        title: "97. Why No Evolution?", 
        instruction: "Evolution denies Jehovah’s creation, as Genesis 2:3 states: 'God proceeded to bless the seventh day... because on it he had been resting from all his work.' False worship credits chance, like Darwinism, but the Bible affirms design (Psalm 139:14). Historically, creation stood against pagan myths. Science marvels at DNA’s complexity, pointing to Jehovah, not random processes.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> God is Creator.", 
        example: "<b>Genesis 2:3</b> - God made them all.\n<b>Psalm 139:14</b> - Wonderfully made.\n<b>Romans 1:20</b> - Qualities seen in creation." 
    },
    { 
        title: "98. What Is True Worship?", 
        instruction: "True worship honors Jehovah alone, as John 4:24 states: 'God is a Spirit, and those worshipping him must worship with spirit and truth.' False worship mixes lies, like pagan syncretism, but the Bible demands purity (Matthew 4:10). Historically, faithful ones like Daniel stood firm. Science can’t define worship, but Jehovah’s Word does.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Based on Scripture.", 
        example: "<b>John 4:24</b> - Worship with spirit and truth.\n<b>Matthew 4:10</b> - Jehovah your God worship.\n<b>Psalm 83:18</b> - Jehovah alone Most High." 
    },
    { 
        title: "99. Why No Fear of Man?", 
        instruction: "Fear belongs to Jehovah, not man, as Matthew 10:28 states: 'Do not become fearful of those who kill the body.' False worship cowers to rulers, like pagan tyrants, but the Bible trusts God’s protection (Proverbs 29:25). Historically, martyrs like Stephen defied man. Science shows fear’s limits, while Jehovah’s power endures.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Trust in Jehovah.", 
        example: "<b>Matthew 10:28</b> - Do not fear those who kill.\n<b>Proverbs 29:25</b> - Fear of man is a snare.\n<b>Isaiah 51:12</b> - Why fear mortal man?" 
    },
    { 
        title: "100. What Is the Reward?", 
        instruction: "The reward is everlasting life for the faithful, as Hebrews 11:6 states: 'He becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.' False worship seeks fleeting gains, like pagan riches, but the Bible offers eternity (Revelation 22:14). Historically, this hope drove Noah and others. Science can’t grant life, but Jehovah’s promise fulfills all.", 
        description: "<b>Hope:</b> Everlasting life.", 
        example: "<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - He becomes the rewarder.\n<b>Revelation 22:14</b> - Right to the trees of life.\n<b>Psalm 37:29</b> - Righteous will live forever."
