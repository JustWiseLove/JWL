                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Adam was the first human created by Jehovah, formed from the dust of the ground and given life through God’s spirit. Placed in the Garden of Eden with his wife, Eve, he was tasked with cultivating the earth and naming the animals. His decision to disobey Jehovah by eating from the forbidden tree introduced sin and death to humanity, affecting all his descendants. Despite this, his creation highlights Jehovah’s purpose to fill the earth with perfect humans living in harmony with Him (Genesis 1:26-28; 2:7-9, 15-17; 3:6-19).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Jehovah God went on to form the man out of dust from the ground." —Genesis 2:7</p>

                        <p>Eve, the first woman, was created as a complement to Adam from one of his ribs, demonstrating Jehovah’s design for marriage. She lived in Eden until she was deceived by the serpent, leading her to eat the forbidden fruit and share it with Adam. Her actions resulted in expulsion from paradise and the introduction of suffering, including pain in childbirth. Eve’s experience teaches the consequences of disobedience and the importance of trusting Jehovah’s guidance (Genesis 2:18-22; 3:1-6, 16-20).</p>

                        <p>Cain, the firstborn son of Adam and Eve, was a farmer who offered produce to Jehovah. His jealousy and anger grew when Jehovah favored his brother Abel’s offering over his own, leading him to murder Abel. Jehovah punished Cain by banishing him, yet showed mercy by protecting him with a mark. Cain’s life illustrates the dangers of unchecked emotions and the need for self-control (Genesis 4:3-16).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"Jehovah said to Cain: ‘Why are you so angry and dejected?’" —Genesis 4:6</p>

                        <p>Abel, the second son of Adam and Eve, was a shepherd whose offering of the firstlings of his flock pleased Jehovah, showing his faith and righteousness. His murder by Cain made him the first martyr, and his blood “cried out” to God, symbolizing the need for justice. Abel’s example highlights the value of heartfelt worship and faithfulness, even under persecution (Genesis 4:2-10; Hebrews 11:4).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">"By faith Abel offered God a sacrifice of greater worth than that of Cain." —Hebrews 11:4</p>

His birth brought comfort to his parents, and his descendants included those who “began to call on the name of Jehovah.” Seth’s life underscores Jehovah’s provision to continue His purpose despite setbacks (Genesis 4:25-26; 5:3-8).</p>

                        <p>Enoch, a descendant of Seth, was a righteous man who “walked with God” in a wicked pre-Flood world. Known for prophesying about Jehovah’s judgment against the ungodly, he did not experience a normal death—Jehovah “took him” at age 365. Enoch’s faith and courage to speak truth make him a model of loyalty (Genesis 5:21-24; Jude 14-15).</p>

His name, possibly meaning “when he dies, it will come,” may hint at the timing of the deluge. As part of the faithful line from Seth, Methuselah’s long life reflects Jehovah’s patience before executing judgment (Genesis 5:25-27).</p>
