                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Choose Jehovah’s Kingdom</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Your Eternal Future</h2>
                        <p>Your life’s defining choice awaits: will you serve Satan’s fleeting world or embrace Jehovah’s eternal Kingdom? Joshua’s challenge echoes today: “Choose for yourselves today whom you will serve… But as for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah” (Joshua 24:15). Only Jehovah’s truth leads to life, as “this means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you” (John 17:3).</p>
                        <h3>Satan’s World: Lies and Deception</h3>
                        <p>This world’s systems—politics, religion, commerce—promise freedom but deliver chaos and despair, as “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19). False doctrines, like the immortal soul or eternal torment, rooted in paganism, contradict the Bible’s truth that the dead are unconscious (Ecclesiastes 9:5).</p>
                        <h3>Jehovah’s Kingdom: Truth and Certainty</h3>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Word reveals His Kingdom, a real government crushing human rule to bring paradise (Daniel 2:44). Unlike human promises, Jehovah cannot lie, offering unshakable hope (Numbers 23:19; Titus 1:2).</p>
                        <h3>Fleeting Pleasures vs. Eternal Joy</h3>
                        <p>Satan’s world tempts with wealth and indulgence, but they vanish (1 John 2:17). Jehovah’s Kingdom erases sickness, sorrow, and death forever, restoring earth to Eden’s glory (Revelation 21:4).</p>
                        <h3>Jehovah’s Standards: A Noble Life</h3>
                        <p>Satan’s world glorifies immorality and greed (2 Timothy 3:1-5). Jehovah’s principles—justice, loyalty, compassion—ennoble humanity, giving purpose now and eternity (Micah 6:8; Colossians 3:12-14).</p>
                        <h3>Your Decision, Your Destiny</h3>
                        <p>Indecision aligns with Satan’s doomed world (Matthew 12:30). Choosing Jehovah means rejecting lies, studying His Word, and living His truth, securing eternal life (John 17:3). Satan’s world crumbles; Jehovah’s Kingdom endures. Choose life!</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(c. 840 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>The earliest extra-biblical evidence of Jehovah’s name, the Tetragrammaton (YHWH), appears in the Moabite Stone, vindicating its centrality in true worship, as “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15).</p>
                        <p><strong>Moabite Stone (Mesha Stele):</strong> Discovered in 1868 at Dhiban, Jordan, this basalt stele, inscribed by King Mesha of Moab, recounts his revolt against Israel (2 Kings 3:4-27). Line 18 mentions capturing “vessels of YHWH” from Nebo, confirming the name’s use in Israel’s worship. Housed in the Louvre Museum, Paris, with a replica in the British Museum, London, it stands as undeniable proof of Jehovah’s prominence, fulfilling “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <h2>Vindicating Jehovah’s Name</h2>
                        <p>Carved by an enemy king, the stele’s reference to YHWH counters Satan’s efforts to obscure the name, as “the god of this system has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4). Radiocarbon-dated to the 9th century BCE, it ensures authenticity.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I am Jehovah, that is my name.” — Isaiah 42:8</p>

                        <h2>(c. 600–590 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>Inscriptions from Judah’s final days before Babylon’s conquest preserve Jehovah’s name, proving its everyday use, as “call on the name of Jehovah” (Joel 2:32).</p>
                        <p><strong>Silver Scrolls (Kuntillet Ajrud):</strong> Found in 1975 in southern Israel, two silver amulets from c. 600 BCE bear blessings invoking “YHWH,” such as “May you be blessed by YHWH of Samaria.” These artifacts, displayed in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, show the name’s role in personal devotion.</p>
                        <p><strong>Lachish Letters:</strong> Ostraca from Lachish, discovered in 1935, include letters from c. 590 BCE mentioning “YHWH,” like “May YHWH cause my lord to hear tidings of peace.” Preserved in the Israel Museum, they reflect the name’s integration in Judahite society.</p>
                        <h2>Enduring Evidence</h2>
                        <p>These artifacts, validated by archaeological methods, confirm Jehovah’s name was known across Israel, countering later attempts to replace it with “Lord,” as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“My people will know my name.” — Isaiah 52:6</p>

                        <h2>(c. 200 BCE–70 CE)</h2>
                        <p>During the Second Temple period, the Dead Sea Scrolls preserved Jehovah’s name amid Hellenistic pressures, as “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19).</p>
                        <p><strong>Dead Sea Scrolls:</strong> Discovered in Qumran (1947–1956), these 900+ manuscripts include “YHWH” in paleo-Hebrew script to distinguish it from other terms. The Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa^a) uses “YHWH” in Isaiah 42:8: “I am Jehovah, that is my name.” Housed in the Israel Museum’s Shrine of the Book, Jerusalem, and the Jordan Museum, Amman, they show the name’s reverence, fulfilling “The word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8).</p>
                        <h2>Resisting Paganism</h2>
                        <p>Faithful scribes preserved “YHWH” against Greek philosophy’s influence, ensuring “My word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This is my name forever.” — Exodus 3:15</p>

                        <p>Early Greek translations of the Hebrew Scriptures retained Jehovah’s name, resisting Hellenistic substitutions, as “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <p><strong>Septuagint Fragments:</strong> Papyrus Fouad 266, dated to the 2nd century BCE, keeps “YHWH” in Hebrew characters rather than “Kyrios” (Lord). Found in Egypt and stored in the Cairo Museum, these fragments reflect diaspora Jews’ reverence for Jehovah’s name, countering pagan influences.</p>
                        <h2>Preserving Sanctity</h2>
                        <p>By retaining “YHWH,” these manuscripts ensured the name’s sanctity, fulfilling “Let them know that you, whose name is Jehovah” (Psalm 83:18).</p>

                        <p>As false worship spread, early Christian codices preserved traces of Jehovah’s name, resisting apostate trends, as “My words will not pass away” (Matthew 24:35).</p>
                        <p><strong>Codex Sinaiticus:</strong> One of the earliest complete Greek Bibles, it occasionally retains “YHWH” in Hebrew script in Old Testament quotes, showing awareness of the name. Housed in the British Library, London, it confirms its use despite growing apostasy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Codex Vaticanus:</strong> This Greek manuscript, stored in the Vatican Library, Rome, preserves Old Testament texts where “YHWH” appeared in originals, supporting its prominence before “Lord” became standard.</p>

                        <p>Jewish scribes meticulously preserved Jehovah’s name in the Middle Ages, countering its removal by false religion, as “the dragon was enraged” (Revelation 12:17).</p>
                        <p><strong>Aleppo Codex (c. 930 CE):</strong> This Masoretic Hebrew Bible contains “YHWH” 6,973 times, vocalized to indicate “Jehovah.” Housed in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, it reflects scrupulous preservation.</p>

                        <p><strong>William Tyndale (1530):</strong> Tyndale’s Pentateuch used “Jehovah” (Exodus 6:3), defying bans. Strangled and burned in 1536, his translations, in the British Library, London, shaped later Bibles, as “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <p><strong>Henry Ainsworth (1612):</strong> His Psalms annotations used “Jehovah,” citing Psalm 83:18. Preserved in the British Library, his work spread the name, as “declare his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24).</p>
                        <p><strong>New World Translation (1950–1961):</strong> Restored “Jehovah” 7,237 times, including 6,973 in the Hebrew Scriptures, based on the Leningrad Codex. Over 240 million copies printed, it counters “Lord” substitutions, as “the word of God is alive” (Hebrews 4:12).</p>
