            <p class="describe">Archaeological discoveries, such as ancient inscriptions bearing “YHWH,” alongside the unchanging truth of the Scriptures, powerfully vindicate Jehovah’s sacred name and His rightful sovereignty. Despite Satan’s relentless efforts to obscure the divine name through false religion and deceptive lies, faithful scribes, translators, and the New World Translation have restored “YHWH” to its rightful prominence. This enduring evidence urges all to reject Satan’s temporary world and embrace Jehovah’s eternal Kingdom, confidently trusting in His supreme rulership over all creation.</p>

                        <h2>Satan’s Challenge and Jehovah’s Vindication</h2>
                        <p>The issue of universal sovereignty—Jehovah’s absolute right to rule as the Creator—lies at the heart of His name’s vindication, as declared: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High” (Psalm 83:18). Satan’s challenge in Eden and beyond questions Jehovah’s authority, but biblical truth and faithful examples demonstrate that His rulership is both just and loving, prevailing over all opposition.</p>
                        <h3>Satan’s Lie</h3>
                        <p>In the garden of Eden, Satan deceived Eve by suggesting that Jehovah’s rule was oppressive, withholding good from humans (Genesis 3:1-5). Later, he accused Jehovah of ruling unjustly, claiming that humans, like Job, serve Him only for selfish gain, not out of genuine love (Job 1:9-11). This lie portrays Jehovah as an unworthy sovereign, revealing Satan as “a liar and the father of the lie” (John 8:44). By challenging Jehovah’s right to rule, Satan seeks to undermine the loyalty of all intelligent creation.</p>
                        <h3>Jehovah’s Response</h3>
                        <p>Rather than destroying Satan immediately, Jehovah lovingly allows time to prove the devil’s accusations false, granting humans the freedom to choose whom they will serve (2 Peter 3:9). Faithful individuals, such as Job, who endured immense suffering yet declared, “May the name of Jehovah continue to be praised” (Job 1:21), demonstrate that humans can serve Jehovah out of love, not merely for blessings. Fulfilled prophecies, like the fall of Babylon in 539 BCE as foretold (Isaiah 46:10-11), further confirm Jehovah’s ability to guide history according to His purpose, proving His rulership is righteous and certain.</p>
                        <h3>Vindication Through the Kingdom</h3>
                        <p>Jehovah’s ultimate vindication comes through Christ’s Kingdom, established in the heavens in 1914, a year marked by global upheaval fulfilling signs like “nation against nation” (Daniel 2:44; Matthew 24:7). This Kingdom decisively casts out Satan’s influence, as “the ruler of this world will be cast out” (Revelation 12:10). Archaeological evidence, such as inscriptions bearing “YHWH,” and the faithful endurance of God’s servants reinforce the truth that “I am Jehovah, there is no other” (Isaiah 45:5), affirming His sovereignty over all creation.</p>
                        <h3>Assurance for the Faithful</h3>
                        <p>The certainty of Jehovah’s vindication strengthens the faithful to reject Satan’s corrupt world, with its temporary pleasures and false promises. They trust in the unbreakable assurance that “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed” (Daniel 2:44). By choosing to honor Jehovah’s name, the faithful align themselves with His eternal purpose, confidently awaiting the day when His sovereignty is universally acknowledged, fulfilling the prayer, “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Moabite Stone: Earliest Inscription</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(c. 840 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>The Moabite Stone, also known as the Mesha Stele, provides the earliest extra-biblical evidence of Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” confirming its central role in true worship long before later attempts to obscure it, as declared: “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). This ancient artifact stands as a powerful witness to Jehovah’s prominence in Israel’s history.</p>
                        <p><strong>Moabite Stone (Mesha Stele):</strong> Discovered in 1868 at Dhiban, Jordan, this basalt stele was inscribed by King Mesha of Moab around 840 BCE, recounting his successful revolt against Israel, as recorded in Scripture (2 Kings 3:4-27). Line 18 explicitly mentions capturing “vessels of YHWH” from a sanctuary at Nebo, verifying that Jehovah’s name was integral to Israel’s worship practices. Housed in the Louvre Museum, Paris, with a replica in the British Museum, London, the stele’s authenticity is confirmed through radiocarbon dating and paleographic analysis, aligning it with the 9th century BCE. Its testimony, etched by an enemy king, underscores the undeniable prominence of “YHWH” in ancient Israel, fulfilling “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <h2>Vindicating Jehovah’s Name</h2>
                        <p>The Moabite Stone’s reference to “YHWH,” carved by a rival ruler, directly counters Satan’s efforts to erase Jehovah’s name from human consciousness, as “the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers” (2 Corinthians 4:4). This artifact proves that Jehovah’s name was not only known but revered in Israel, even acknowledged by its enemies. By preserving this evidence, Jehovah ensures that His name remains a beacon of truth, resisting centuries of attempts by false religion to replace “YHWH” with generic titles like “Lord,” thus vindicating His identity as the one true God.</p>

                        <h2>(c. 600–590 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>Just before Babylon’s conquest of Judah, the Silver Scrolls and Lachish Letters preserved Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” demonstrating its widespread use in daily life and worship, as urged: “Call on the name of Jehovah” (Joel 2:32). These artifacts provide tangible evidence of the name’s significance in Judahite society.</p>
                        <p><strong>Silver Scrolls (Kuntillet Ajrud):</strong> Unearthed in 1975 in southern Israel, these two tiny silver amulets, dated to around 600 BCE, are inscribed with blessings invoking “YHWH,” such as “May you be blessed by YHWH of Samaria and by His Asherah.” While the reference to Asherah reflects pagan influences, the use of “YHWH” confirms that Jehovah’s name was central to personal devotion among the Israelites. Displayed in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, these scrolls, validated by archaeological analysis, highlight the name’s role in private worship, even in a time of spiritual decline.</p>
                        <p><strong>Lachish Letters:</strong> Discovered in 1935 at the Lachish fortress, these ostraca (pottery shards) from around 590 BCE include military correspondence mentioning “YHWH,” such as “May YHWH cause my lord to hear tidings of peace today.” Written just before Jerusalem’s fall, they show that Jehovah’s name was used in everyday communication among Judah’s leaders. Preserved in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, these letters affirm the name’s integration into both religious and secular life, resisting efforts to diminish its prominence.</p>
                        <h2>Enduring Evidence</h2>
                        <p>Validated by rigorous archaeological methods, including paleography and contextual analysis, the Silver Scrolls and Lachish Letters prove that “YHWH” was a familiar and cherished name across all levels of Judahite society. Their survival counters later attempts by false religion to replace Jehovah’s name with titles like “Lord,” ensuring that “the word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25). These artifacts stand as a testament to Jehovah’s promise that His name would remain known, strengthening the faithful to proclaim it boldly in the face of opposition.</p>

                        <h2>(c. 200 BCE–70 CE)</h2>
                        <p>During the Second Temple period, when Hellenistic culture threatened true worship, the Dead Sea Scrolls preserved Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” with remarkable care, demonstrating the devotion of faithful scribes amid a world under Satan’s influence, as “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19).</p>
                        <p><strong>Dead Sea Scrolls:</strong> Discovered between 1947 and 1956 in the Qumran caves near the Dead Sea, these 900+ manuscripts, dated from 200 BCE to 70 CE, include nearly every book of the Hebrew Scriptures. The Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa^a), one of the most complete, prominently uses “YHWH” in paleo-Hebrew script, as seen in Isaiah 42:8: “I am Jehovah, that is my name.” This deliberate use of an archaic script underscores the name’s sanctity, distinguishing it from other terms. Housed in the Israel Museum’s Shrine of the Book, Jerusalem, and the Jordan Museum, Amman, the scrolls, dated through carbon-14 and paleographic analysis, were likely preserved by the Essenes, a Jewish sect dedicated to scriptural purity. Their work ensured that Jehovah’s name remained intact, fulfilling “The word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8).</p>
                        <h2>Resisting Paganism</h2>
                        <p>The Dead Sea Scrolls’ meticulous preservation of “YHWH” stood firm against the encroaching influence of Greek philosophy and pagan practices, which sought to dilute true worship. By safeguarding the Hebrew Scriptures, these faithful scribes ensured that Jehovah’s name and His promises would not be forgotten, as “My word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11). This enduring testimony counters Satan’s efforts to obscure the divine name, providing a foundation for later restorations, such as the New World Translation, which relies on these pure texts to proclaim Jehovah’s sovereignty.</p>

                        <h2>(c. 200 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>In the face of Hellenistic pressures, early Greek translations of the Hebrew Scriptures, known as the Septuagint, retained Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” resisting the trend to replace it with generic titles, thus upholding the truth that “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <p><strong>Septuagint Fragments:</strong> Papyrus Fouad 266, a 2nd-century BCE manuscript found in Egypt, preserves “YHWH” in Hebrew characters within Greek text, notably in passages like Deuteronomy 32:8-9, rather than substituting “Kyrios” (Lord), as later copies did. Stored in the Cairo Museum, this fragment, dated through paleographic analysis, reflects the reverence of Jewish scholars in Alexandria for Jehovah’s name. These translators, working around 280–150 BCE, ensured that Greek-speaking Jews in the diaspora could honor the divine name, countering the influence of pagan philosophies that sought to diminish its significance.</p>
                        <h2>Preserving Sanctity</h2>
                        <p>By retaining “YHWH” in its original Hebrew form, these Septuagint fragments preserved the sanctity of Jehovah’s name, fulfilling the declaration, “Let them know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High” (Psalm 83:18). Their survival provides critical evidence that early Jewish communities resisted Hellenistic attempts to erase the divine name, laying a foundation for later efforts to restore it, such as in the New World Translation. This steadfast commitment ensures that Jehovah’s identity remains clear, even amidst Satan’s efforts to obscure it through false worship.</p>

                        <h2>(c. 350 CE)</h2>
                        <p>As apostate Christianity grew in the 4th century, early Christian codices, such as Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, preserved traces of Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” despite the increasing substitution of “Kyrios” (Lord), fulfilling the promise that “My words will not pass away” (Matthew 24:35). These manuscripts played a vital role in safeguarding the Scriptures during a time of spiritual corruption, though they faced challenges that required later correction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Codex Sinaiticus:</strong> Compiled around 350 CE, this is one of the earliest complete Greek Bibles, discovered at Saint Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai and now housed in the British Library, London. It occasionally retains “YHWH” in Hebrew script within Old Testament quotations, particularly in passages like Psalm 83:18, showing that some scribes recognized the name’s importance. However, its inconsistent use of “YHWH” and inclusion of uninspired texts, such as the Apocrypha (e.g., Tobit), reflect the influence of apostate trends that sought to dilute true worship. The codex’s preservation of early Christian Scriptures, dated through paleographic analysis and radiocarbon testing, provided a critical link to the original texts, despite these flaws.</p>
                        <p><strong>Codex Vaticanus:</strong> Also dated to around 350 CE, this Greek manuscript, stored in the Vatican Library, Rome, preserves Old Testament texts where “YHWH” appeared in the Hebrew originals, though it typically uses “Kyrios” due to prevailing Jewish and Christian traditions avoiding the divine name. Like Sinaiticus, it includes uninspired Apocryphal books and lacks certain passages, such as Mark 16:9-20, indicating textual variations. Its survival, validated by archaeological methods, ensured that traces of Jehovah’s name endured, even as false religion sought to obscure it.</p>
                        <h2>Faithful Preservation</h2>
                        <p>Despite their flaws, such as inconsistent use of “YHWH” and the inclusion of uninspired texts, Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus were monumental in preserving the Scriptures during a period of widespread apostasy, ensuring that “the word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25). Faithful scribes, under pressure from doctrinal disputes and Roman persecution, maintained the core of God’s Word, providing a foundation for later translations like the New World Translation, which corrected these errors by restoring “YHWH” consistently. These codices stand as a testament to Jehovah’s ability to safeguard His truth, even through imperfect human efforts, countering Satan’s attempts to suppress His name.</p>

                        <h2>(c. 930–1008 CE)</h2>
                        <p>In the Middle Ages, Jewish scribes known as Masoretes meticulously preserved Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” in the Hebrew Scriptures, countering efforts by false religion to remove it, as Satan, “the dragon, was enraged with the woman” (Revelation 12:17). Their work ensured that Jehovah’s name remained clear and accessible for future generations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Aleppo Codex (c. 930 CE):</strong> Crafted in Tiberias, this Masoretic Hebrew Bible is one of the most authoritative texts of the Hebrew Scriptures, containing “YHWH” 6,973 times, with vowel points indicating the pronunciation “Jehovah.” Housed in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, the codex, dated through paleographic analysis, reflects the Masoretes’ rigorous methods, such as counting letters and verses to ensure accuracy. Its preservation of “YHWH” in every instance where it appeared in the original texts provided a reliable source for later translations, resisting centuries of attempts to replace the divine name with titles.</p>
                        <p><strong>Leningrad Codex (c. 1008 CE):</strong> The oldest complete Hebrew Bible, this manuscript, located in the National Library of Russia, St. Petersburg, also includes “YHWH” 6,973 times, with precise vowel points for “Jehovah.” Copied in Cairo, it aligns closely with the Aleppo Codex, confirming the Masoretes’ unparalleled accuracy. Its detailed annotations, or Masorah, safeguarded the text against errors, ensuring that Jehovah’s name and His Word remained pure, as “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8). The Leningrad Codex serves as a primary source for modern translations, including the New World Translation.</p>
                        <h2>Masoretic Fidelity</h2>
                        <p>The Masoretes’ commitment to preserving “YHWH” with vowel points clarified its pronunciation as “Jehovah,” directly fulfilling the declaration, “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High” (Psalm 83:18). Unlike earlier codices that sometimes used “Kyrios” or included uninspired texts, the Masoretic texts are remarkably free of significant flaws, offering a pure transmission of the Hebrew Scriptures. Their work countered Satan’s efforts to obscure Jehovah’s name through false religion, providing a solid foundation for the New World Translation to restore “YHWH” accurately and consistently, ensuring that Jehovah’s identity is proclaimed worldwide.</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(16th–20th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>From the Reformation to the 20th century, faithful servants courageously restored Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” overcoming Satan’s lies and the suppression of false religion, fulfilling the promise, “I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on the name of Jehovah” (Zephaniah 3:9). Their efforts, culminating in the New World Translation, decisively vindicated Jehovah’s name, though earlier attempts faced significant challenges.</p>
                        <p><strong>William Tyndale (1530):</strong> Tyndale’s groundbreaking translation of the Pentateuch into English boldly used “Jehovah” in key passages, such as Exodus 6:3, defying Catholic bans on vernacular Bibles. Facing persecution, he was strangled and burned at the stake in 1536, yet his work, preserved in the British Library, London, influenced later translations like the King James Version. Tyndale’s limited use of “Jehovah” and reliance on incomplete manuscripts, such as the Latin Vulgate, restricted his impact, but his courage laid a foundation for restoring the divine name, aligning with “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <p><strong>Henry Ainsworth (1612):</strong> Ainsworth, a Puritan scholar, used “Jehovah” in his annotations on the Psalms, notably citing Psalm 83:18 to emphasize its importance. His work, preserved in the British Library, helped spread awareness of the divine name among English-speaking believers. However, his focus on annotations rather than a full translation and the prevailing use of “Lord” in other Bibles limited his influence, necessitating further restoration efforts to counter the widespread suppression of “YHWH.”</p>
                        <p><strong>New World Translation (1950–1961):</strong> The New World Translation, released in stages and revised in 2013, restored “Jehovah” 7,237 times, including 6,973 instances in the Hebrew Scriptures and 264 in the Christian Scriptures, based on early manuscripts like the Leningrad Codex and Papyrus Fouad 266. With over 240 million copies printed in more than 200 languages, it decisively counters the substitution of “Lord” in earlier translations, such as the King James Version, which used “Jehovah” only four times. By relying on the oldest texts and excluding uninspired additions, the NWT ensures that “the word of God is alive and exerts power” (Hebrews 4:12), providing an accurate and unbiased representation of Jehovah’s name and His truth.</p>
                        <h2>Global Proclamation</h2>
                        <p>Supported by archaeological discoveries like the Moabite Stone and Dead Sea Scrolls, the efforts of Tyndale, Ainsworth, and the New World Translation have ensured that “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). While Tyndale and Ainsworth faced persecution and limited manuscript access, the NWT overcame these challenges through scholarly rigor and global distribution, equipping Jehovah’s Witnesses to proclaim His name in 240 lands, even amidst opposition like Russia’s 2017 ban. This modern restoration decisively vindicates Jehovah’s name, countering centuries of Satan’s lies and fulfilling the call, “You are my witnesses,” says Jehovah (Isaiah 43:10).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You are my witnesses,” says Jehovah. — Isaiah 43:10</p>
