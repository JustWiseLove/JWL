                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Your Life’s Most Vital Decision</h2>
                        <p>Your life’s most vital decision looms: will you serve Satan’s fleeting world or embrace Jehovah’s everlasting Kingdom? Joshua’s challenge rings true today: “Choose for yourselves today whom you will serve… But as for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah” (Joshua 24:15). Temporary relief or permanent solution? Only Jehovah’s truth leads to life. Why choose His Kingdom?</p>
                        <h3>Satan’s World: Lies and Deception</h3>
                        <p>This world’s systems—politics, religion, commerce—promise freedom but breed chaos, greed, and despair (1 John 5:19). False teachings, like the immortal soul or eternal torment, rooted in human tradition, contradict the Bible’s truth that the dead are unconscious (Ecclesiastes 9:5).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one. — 1 John 5:19</p>
                        <h3>Jehovah’s Kingdom: Truth and Honesty</h3>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Word cuts through deception, revealing His Kingdom as a real government that will crush human rule and bring peace (Daniel 2:44). Unlike shifting human promises, Jehovah’s word is unbreakable; He cannot lie (Numbers 23:19).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">God is not a man that he should lie… — Numbers 23:19</p>
                        <h3>Temporary Relief vs. Permanent Solution</h3>
                        <p>Satan’s world tempts with short-lived pleasures—wealth, status, indulgence—but they vanish (1 John 2:17). Jehovah’s Kingdom will transform earth into a paradise, erasing pain, sickness, and death forever (Revelation 21:4).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">God will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more… — Revelation 21:4</p>
                        <h3>Moral Standards That Endure</h3>
                        <p>Satan’s world glorifies selfishness, immorality, and violence, degrading humanity (2 Timothy 3:1-5). Jehovah’s standards—love, integrity, purity—uplift lives and build lasting joy (Colossians 3:12-14).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Put on the new personality that was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty. — Ephesians 4:24</p>
                        <h3>Your Choice Shapes Your Future</h3>
                        <p>There’s no middle ground; indecision aligns with Satan’s world (Matthew 12:30). Choosing Jehovah means rejecting false teachings, studying His Word, and living His truth (John 4:23). This decision unlocks the path to everlasting life.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God… — John 17:3</p>
                        <p>Satan’s world is doomed to collapse; Jehovah’s Kingdom stands forever. Make the choice that secures your future—serve Jehovah and inherit life eternal!</p>
                        <p class="scripture">The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. — Psalm 37:11</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Your Choice, Your Life!</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Your Eternal Future</h2>
                        <p>Your choice today determines your eternal future: will you cling to Satan’s fading world or embrace Jehovah’s promise of life? Deuteronomy’s urgent call resonates: “Choose life, that you and your offspring may live” (Deuteronomy 30:19). By choosing Jehovah, you reject deception, live His truth, and secure everlasting life. Why is this choice critical?</p>
                        <h3>Satan’s World: A Path to Death</h3>
                        <p>Under Satan’s influence, this world promotes lies—false religions, materialism, and moral decay—that lead to destruction (2 Corinthians 4:4). Teachings like the immortal soul or eternal torment deceive millions, but the Bible reveals the dead are unconscious (Ecclesiastes 9:10).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">The god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers… — 2 Corinthians 4:4</p>
                        <h3>Jehovah’s Truth: The Way to Life</h3>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Word exposes lies and reveals His Kingdom, a real government that will restore earth to paradise (Isaiah 9:7). His promises never fail, offering hope and certainty in an unstable world (Titus 1:2).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">In the hope of the everlasting life that God, who cannot lie, promised… — Titus 1:2</p>
                        <h3>Fleeting Pleasures vs. Eternal Joy</h3>
                        <p>Satan’s world entices with temporary thrills—wealth, fame, indulgence—but they end in emptiness (1 John 2:17). Jehovah’s Kingdom brings lasting happiness, erasing sorrow, sickness, and death forever (Revelation 21:4).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">God will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more… — Revelation 21:4</p>
                        <h3>Jehovah’s Standards: A Life of Purpose</h3>
                        <p>This world’s selfishness and immorality degrade humanity (Romans 1:28-32). Jehovah’s principles—love, honesty, compassion—ennoble lives, giving meaning now and preparing you for eternity (Micah 6:8).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">He has told you, O man, what is good. And what is Jehovah requiring of you? Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty, and to walk in modesty with your God. — Micah 6:8</p>
                        <h3>Your Decision, Your Destiny</h3>
                        <p>There’s no neutrality; indecision sides with Satan’s doomed world (Revelation 3:15-16). Choosing Jehovah means studying His Word, rejecting falsehoods, and living His way—your path to everlasting life (John 17:3).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God… — John 17:3</p>
                        <p>Satan’s world is crumbling; Jehovah’s Kingdom is forever. Your choice shapes your life—choose Jehovah and live eternally!</p>
                        <p class="scripture">The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it. — Psalm 37:29</p>

                        <h2>(9th–6th Century BCE)</h2>
                        <p>The earliest extra-biblical evidence of Jehovah’s name, the Tetragrammaton (YHWH), appears in inscriptions from the First Temple period, vindicating its centrality in true worship: “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). Despite Satan’s efforts to obscure it, as “the god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), these artifacts preserve Jehovah’s identity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Moabite Stone (Mesha Stele, c. 840 BCE):</strong> Discovered in 1868 at Dhiban, Jordan, this basalt stele, inscribed by King Mesha of Moab, recounts his revolt against Israel (2 Kings 3:4-27). Line 18 mentions capturing “vessels of YHWH” from Nebo, confirming the name’s use in Israel’s worship. Housed in the Louvre Museum, Paris, with a replica in the British Museum, London, it stands as a testament to Jehovah’s prominence, fulfilling “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <p><strong>Silver Scrolls (Kuntillet Ajrud, c. 600 BCE):</strong> Found in 1975 in southern Israel, two silver amulets bear blessings invoking “YHWH,” such as “May you be blessed by YHWH of Samaria.” These pre-exilic artifacts, displayed in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, show the name’s use in personal devotion, echoing “Call on the name of Jehovah” (Joel 2:32).</p>
                        <p><strong>Lachish Letters (c. 590 BCE):</strong> Ostraca from Lachish, Israel, discovered in 1935, include letters mentioning “YHWH,” like “May YHWH cause my lord to hear tidings of peace.” Preserved in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, they reflect the name’s everyday use in Judah, as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <p><strong>Arad Ostraca (c. 600 BCE):</strong> Pottery shards from Arad, Israel, mention “YHWH” in administrative texts, showing its integration in Judahite society. Housed in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, they affirm the name’s widespread use.</p>
                        <h2>Vindicating Jehovah’s Sovereignty</h2>
                        <p>These inscriptions, from Moabite enemies to faithful Israelites, prove Jehovah’s name was known across the ancient Near East, countering later attempts to replace it with “Lord.” Archaeological discoveries, validated by radiocarbon dating, ensure their authenticity, fulfilling “Let them know that you, whose name is Jehovah” (Psalm 83:18).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I am Jehovah, that is my name.” — Isaiah 42:8</p>

                        <h2>(3rd Century BCE–1st Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>During the Second Temple period, Jehovah’s name remained central despite growing Hellenistic influences, as “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19). Manuscripts preserved YHWH, vindicating its use in true worship.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dead Sea Scrolls (c. 200 BCE–70 CE):</strong> Discovered in Qumran (1947–1956), these 900+ manuscripts include “YHWH” in paleo-Hebrew script to distinguish it from other terms. The Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa^a) uses “YHWH” in Isaiah 42:8: “I am Jehovah, that is my name.” Housed in the Israel Museum’s Shrine of the Book, Jerusalem, and the Jordan Museum, Amman, they show the name’s reverence, fulfilling “The word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8).</p>
                        <p><strong>Septuagint Fragments (c. 200 BCE):</strong> Early Greek translations, like Papyrus Fouad 266, retained “YHWH” in Hebrew characters rather than “Kyrios” (Lord). Found in Egypt and dated to the 2nd century BCE, these fragments, stored in the Cairo Museum, Egypt, reflect the name’s sanctity among diaspora Jews, as “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <h2>Resisting Pagan Influence</h2>
                        <p>Despite pressures from Greek philosophy, faithful scribes preserved Jehovah’s name, countering apostate trends that later obscured it. These manuscripts, preserved through divine protection, affirm “My word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This is my name forever.” — Exodus 3:15</p>

                        <h2>(1st–4th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>As false worship infiltrated Christianity after the apostles, as warned in Acts 20:29, faithful ones preserved Jehovah’s name in early codices, resisting “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5).</p>
                        <p><strong>Codex Sinaiticus (c. 350 CE):</strong> One of the earliest complete Greek Bibles, it occasionally retains “YHWH” in Hebrew script in Old Testament quotes, showing early Christian awareness of the name. Housed in the British Library, London, it confirms the name’s use despite growing apostasy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Codex Vaticanus (c. 350 CE):</strong> This Greek manuscript, stored in the Vatican Library, Rome, preserves Old Testament texts where “YHWH” appeared in Hebrew originals, supporting its prominence before “Lord” substitutions became standard.</p>
                        <p><strong>Codex Alexandrinus (c. 450 CE):</strong> Containing “YHWH” in some Septuagint portions, this manuscript, in the British Library, London, shows the name’s endurance amid persecution, as “the word of God is not bound” (2 Timothy 2:9).</p>
                        <h2>Faithful Scribes</h2>
                        <p>Scribes like Jerome (347–420 CE), despite Nicaea’s errors, included “YHWH” in the Latin Vulgate (405 CE), preserved in libraries like the Bodleian, Oxford. Their efforts ensured “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25), preparing for future restoration.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“My words will by no means pass away.” — Matthew 24:35</p>

                        <p>During the Middle Ages, Jewish scribes meticulously preserved Jehovah’s name, countering its removal by false religion, as “the dragon was enraged” (Revelation 12:17).</p>
                        <p><strong>Cairo Geniza Fragments (9th–10th Century CE):</strong> Hebrew manuscripts from Cairo’s Ben Ezra Synagogue include “YHWH” in biblical texts. Discovered in the 19th century, they are housed in the Cambridge University Library, UK, showing the name’s continuity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Aleppo Codex (c. 930 CE):</strong> This Masoretic Hebrew Bible contains “YHWH” 6,973 times, vocalized to indicate “Jehovah.” Housed in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, it reflects scrupulous preservation, fulfilling “The word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8).</p>
                        <p><strong>Leningrad Codex (c. 1008 CE):</strong> The oldest complete Hebrew Bible, it includes “YHWH” 6,973 times, with vowel points for “Jehovah.” Located in the National Library of Russia, St. Petersburg, it underpins modern translations, vindicating the name’s accuracy.</p>
                        <h2>Masoretic Fidelity</h2>
                        <p>The Masoretes’ vowel points clarified “YHWH” as “Jehovah,” resisting apostate substitutions like “Adonai.” Their work, preserved through centuries, ensures “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>

                        <h2>(14th–17th Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Reformation sparked efforts to restore Jehovah’s name, as faithful ones rejected false doctrines, fulfilling “Those in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another” (Malachi 3:16).</p>
                        <p><strong>John Wycliffe (1382):</strong> His English Bible, though based on the Latin Vulgate, inspired later translators to restore “YHWH.” Burned posthumously, his work, in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, paved the way for truth, as “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p>
                        <p><strong>William Tyndale (1530):</strong> Tyndale’s Pentateuch used “Jehovah” in places like Exodus 6:3, defying bans. Strangled and burned in 1536, his translations, in the British Library, London, shaped the King James Version, fulfilling “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <p><strong>Henry Ainsworth (1612):</strong> His Psalms annotations used “Jehovah,” citing Psalm 83:18. Preserved in the British Library, London, his work influenced Puritans, as “declare his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24).</p>
                        <p><strong>King James Version (1611):</strong> Rendered “Jehovah” in four places (e.g., Psalm 83:18), though “LORD” prevailed. Originals in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, show partial restoration amid apostate resistance.</p>
                        <h2>Breaking Apostate Chains</h2>
                        <p>These translators faced persecution from “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5), yet their efforts restored Jehovah’s name, ensuring “My word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11).</p>

                        <p><strong>Henry Grew (1820s):</strong> Rejected Trinity and hellfire, teaching “Jehovah” as God’s name. His writings, preserved in archives like the British Museum, influenced Charles Taze Russell, as “I will give you shepherds” (Jeremiah 3:15).</p>
                        <p><strong>Charles Taze Russell (1870s):</strong> Founded the Bible Students, emphasizing “Jehovah” in <em>Zion’s Watch Tower</em> (1879). Archives in the British Museum confirm their focus on the name, fulfilling “This good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p><strong>New World Translation (1950–1961):</strong> Restored “Jehovah” 7,237 times, including 6,973 in the Hebrew Scriptures, based on the Leningrad Codex. Over 240 million copies printed, it counters “Lord” substitutions, as “the word of God is alive” (Hebrews 4:12).</p>
                        <h2>Global Proclamation</h2>
