                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>To accept Bible truth, your personality matters. Some resist because they’ve been indoctrinated with lies for years. Jehovah seeks those with the right traits to break free and learn. What are they?</p>
                        <p><strong>Are you hungry for truth?</strong> A deep desire to know Jehovah drives you to seek His Word over human traditions.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Matthew 5:6 - “Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Are you honest with yourself?</strong> Facing the truth means admitting you might have been misled—hard, but vital for growth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Proverbs 12:17 - “The one speaking truth declares what is right, but a false witness speaks deceit.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Are you humble enough to change?</strong> Pride blocks learning; humility opens your heart to Jehovah’s correction.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">James 4:6 - “God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Are you open-minded to new ideas?</strong> Overcoming indoctrination requires examining the Bible without prejudice.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Acts 17:11 - “They accepted the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily.”</p>
                        <p><strong>Do you have courage to stand apart?</strong> Truth often means rejecting popular lies—courage keeps you firm.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">Joshua 1:9 - “Be courageous and strong… for Jehovah your God is with you.”</p>
                        <p>These traits—hunger, honesty, humility, open-mindedness, and courage—equip you to see past a lifetime of lies and embrace Jehovah’s truth!</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>1914 marks the pivotal year when Jehovah enthroned Jesus as King in heaven, beginning his invisible presence and the last days, as foretold in Bible prophecy. Calculated from Daniel’s “seven times” and linked to Revelation, it saw global upheaval—war, pestilence, and distress—fulfilling Jesus’ sign. Jehovah’s Witnesses proclaim this turning point, urging readiness for the Kingdom’s full arrival.</p>
                    <p>It’s prophesied.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Daniel 4:25 - “Seven times will pass over you… Most High is Ruler.”</p>
                    <p>Jesus rules.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Revelation 11:15 - “The kingdom of the world has become… our Lord’s and… his Christ.”</p>
                    <p>Signs confirm it.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Matthew 24:7 - “Nation will rise against nation… famines… earthquakes.”</p>
                    <p>It warns us.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">2 Timothy 3:1 - “In the last days critical times hard to deal with.”</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>Angels are powerful spirit creatures created by Jehovah long before the physical universe came into existence. These beings reside in the heavens, serving as messengers and executors of God’s will across creation. Unlike humans, they possess no physical form and exist solely as spirits, invisible to the human eye unless Jehovah permits them to materialize. The Bible reveals their vast numbers and diverse roles, from delivering divine messages to protecting the faithful and carrying out judgments against the wicked. Their existence underscores Jehovah’s supreme authority and the organized structure of His heavenly government.</p>
                    <p>The Bible identifies them as spirits, not human souls.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Hebrews 1:14 - “Are they not all spirits for public service, sent out to minister?”</p>
                    <p>History shows angels interacted with humans to deliver God’s messages.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Luke 1:26 - “The angel Gabriel was sent from God.”</p>
                    <p>They are mighty, executing Jehovah’s judgments.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">2 Kings 19:35 - “The angel of Jehovah struck down 185,000.”</p>
                    <p>Science cannot detect them, proving their spirit nature.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Psalm 104:4 - “He makes his angels spirits.”</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>The anointed are a select group of 144,000 faithful servants chosen by Jehovah to rule with Christ in heaven, distinct from the majority who hope for earthly life. Called by God’s spirit, they receive a heavenly hope, confirmed at baptism, to serve as kings and priests in His Kingdom. The Bible limits this number, showing their role as a “little flock” amidst a greater crowd of faithful ones. Their anointing began with Jesus’ disciples at Pentecost and continues until the full number is sealed, fulfilling God’s purpose for a heavenly government.</p>
                    <p>The Bible caps their number at 144,000.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Revelation 14:1 - “The Lamb… with 144,000.”</p>
                    <p>They rule with Christ.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Revelation 5:10 - “Made them… priests… reign over the earth.”</p>
                    <p>History ties it to Pentecost.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Acts 2:4 - “Filled with holy spirit.”</p>
                    <p>It’s a heavenly calling.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Luke 12:32 - “Your Father… giving you the Kingdom.”</p>

                    <p>Anxiety is a burden Jehovah promises to lift from His servants, offering peace through trust in Him amid this world’s turmoil. The Bible urges us to cast worries on God, who sustains us in trials, as Jesus taught against fretting over daily needs. This relief strengthens us for the ministry, assuring us of His care until the Kingdom ends all distress.</p>
                    <p>It’s cast on Jehovah.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">1 Peter 5:7 - “Throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.”</p>
                    <p>Jesus eased it.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Matthew 6:34 - “Never be anxious about the next day.”</p>
                    <p>History shows trust works.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Psalm 55:22 - “Throw your burden on Jehovah… he will sustain you.”</p>
                    <p>Peace replaces it.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Philippians 4:6 - “Do not be anxious over anything… the peace of God.”</p>

                    <p>Armageddon is the climactic war of Jehovah God, foretold in prophecy as the decisive battle that will end all wickedness on earth. This event is not a random conflict but a deliberate act of divine intervention, orchestrated by Jehovah to destroy Satan’s system and establish His righteous rule. Unlike human wars, which bring chaos and suffering without resolution, Armageddon promises a permanent end to evil, ushering in a new era of peace and justice. It is the culmination of God’s judgment against those who oppose His sovereignty, fulfilling His purpose to cleanse the earth for the meek who will inherit it.</p>
                    <p>The Bible calls it God’s battle, not man’s.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Revelation 16:16 - “They are gathering… to the place… called Armageddon.”</p>
                    <p>History shows human wars fail; Armageddon succeeds.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Psalm 46:9 - “He is bringing an end to wars.”</p>
                    <p>It ushers in a righteous new world.</p>

                    <p>Atonement is Jehovah’s provision through Jesus’ ransom to reconcile mankind to Him, removing the stain of Adamic sin. It restores our relationship with God, offering forgiveness and life to those who accept it. Jehovah’s justice and love shine in this act, fulfilled perfectly by Christ’s sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>Atonement bridges the gap sin created.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Romans 5:11 - “We enjoy… reconciliation through our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

                    <p>Jehovah’s authority is the foundation of all existence, establishing Him as the supreme Sovereign over heaven and earth. As the Creator of all things, He alone holds the right to rule, a position unchallenged by any power except Satan’s temporary rebellion. This authority is not arbitrary but rooted in His perfect justice, wisdom, and love, ensuring that all creation operates under His divine order. From the angels in heaven to humans on earth, every being is subject to His will, and even Jesus Christ, His Son, acknowledges Jehovah as the ultimate head. This universal authority will be fully vindicated when God’s Kingdom triumphs over all opposition.</p>
                    <p>The Bible declares Him the Sovereign Ruler.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">1 Chronicles 29:11 - “Yours, O Jehovah, are… the kingdom; you are supreme over everything.”</p>

                    <p>Baptism is far more than a ritual; it is a sacred, public declaration of one’s complete dedication to Jehovah God. Performed by full immersion in water, it symbolizes the washing away of a person’s former life of sin and their commitment to live according to God’s standards. This act follows a thorough understanding of Bible truth and a heartfelt decision to serve Jehovah, distinguishing it from infant sprinkling practiced by many religions. Rooted in the example of Jesus and the early Christians, baptism marks the beginning of a new life devoted to doing God’s will and sharing His message with others.</p>
                    <p>The Bible requires it as a public declaration.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Acts 8:36 - “Look! Here is water; what prevents me from getting baptized?”</p>
                    <p>History confirms early Christians immersed fully.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Matthew 3:16 - “Jesus… came up from the water.”</p>
                    <p>It symbolizes dying to sin.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Romans 6:4 - “Buried with him through our baptism.”</p>
                    <p>Understanding precedes it, not infancy.</p>

                    <p>Bible study is the diligent pursuit of Jehovah’s truth, vital for spiritual growth and equipping us to teach others His will. It’s a personal and collective effort, as the Bereans showed, building faith and wisdom for these last days. The Bible urges constant meditation on its words, ensuring we stand firm until the Kingdom comes.</p>
                    <p>It’s commanded.</p>

                    <p>Bible translation, per Jehovah’s will, makes His truth accessible, as with the New World Translation (NWT), which restores His name “Jehovah” over 7,000 times and uses modern language for clarity, correcting errors of biased versions like the King James Version (KJV). The KJV, commissioned in 1611 by King James I, retains archaic English, omits God’s name (replacing it with “LORD”), and reflects Trinitarian bias and political influence, distorting scriptures like 1 John 5:7. The NWT counters such corruptions, ensuring accuracy for pure worship today, a task Jehovah’s people uphold until His Kingdom rules.</p>
                    <p>It’s God’s truth.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Psalm 119:160 - “The substance of your word is truth.”</p>
                    <p>It restores His name.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Isaiah 42:8 - “I am Jehovah, that is my name.” - NWT restores ‘Jehovah’ while KJV uses ‘LORD,’ obscuring God’s identity.</p>
                    <p>It demands clarity.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Nehemiah 8:8 - “Reading… giving the meaning.” - NWT’s modern terms aid understanding; KJV’s old English confuses.</p>
                    <p>It aids pure worship.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">John 17:17 - “Your word is truth.” - NWT removes KJV’s bias, like added words in 1 John 5:7, for true doctrine.</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>Birthdays, widely celebrated today, have no basis in true worship and are rooted in pagan traditions that Jehovah condemns. The Bible mentions only two birthday celebrations, both tied to godless rulers—Pharaoh and Herod—and each linked to violent acts, not godly rejoicing. Historically, these observances stem from superstitions like astrology and the worship of false gods, practices explicitly forbidden in Scripture. True worshipers of Jehovah focus on honoring Him daily, not exalting individuals through annual rituals. By rejecting birthdays, the faithful demonstrate loyalty to God’s standards over human customs.</p>
                    <p>The Bible links them to godless events.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Genesis 40:20 - “Pharaoh’s birthday… he executed the chief baker.”</p>
                    <p>History ties them to astrology and idolatry.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Deuteronomy 18:10 - “No one employing divination.”</p>
                    <p>True worship exalts Jehovah, not self.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">Ecclesiastes 7:1 - “A good name is better than… the day of one’s birth.”</p>
                    <p>Early Christians rejected them.</p>

                    <p>Blood holds a sacred place in Jehovah’s eyes, representing the life He alone gives and sustains. From the time of Noah, God commanded that blood be treated with respect, prohibiting its consumption and misuse, a law reaffirmed for Christians in the first century. This divine standard reflects blood’s unique role as the carrier of life, a truth science confirms but cannot override with human reasoning. Jehovah’s view is clear: blood is not for transfusions or casual use but is reserved for atonement, ultimately fulfilled through Jesus’ sacrifice.

                    <p>The idea that Jesus died on a cross is a distortion of truth rooted in pagan symbolism, not Scripture. The Greek word “stauros” used in the Bible refers to an upright stake or pole, not a two-beamed cross, aligning with Roman execution methods of the time. The cross, a pre-Christian idol, was later adopted by false religion to blend pagan beliefs with Christianity, a practice Jehovah abhors. True followers reject this symbol, honoring Jesus’ sacrifice on a stake as the means of ransom, not venerating an object tied to idolatry.</p>

The Bible likens it to sleep, where the dead have no awareness, thoughts, or activity, contradicting myths of immortal souls or eternal torment. Introduced through Adam’s sin, death is the penalty for disobedience, but Jehovah offers hope through resurrection, not immediate reward or punishment. This truth exposes pagan lies adopted by false religion, affirming that life’s continuation depends solely on God’s power and promise to restore the dead.</p>

Early Christians commemorated Jesus’ death, not his resurrection, as the pivotal event for salvation, observing it annually as instructed. Jehovah forbids mixing His worship with idolatrous practices, making Easter a human tradition that true worshipers reject in favor of pure devotion to Him.</p>
                    <p>The Bible omits Easter customs.</p>

This period, unlike any in history, will see global upheaval, yet Jehovah promises to cut it short for the sake of His chosen ones.

                    <p>Hell, as taught by the Bible, is simply the common grave of mankind, not a fiery place of eternal torment. The idea of hellfire stems from pagan myths, not Jehovah’s Word, which states that death is the cessation of life, a state of unconsciousness. God’s justice does not involve torturing souls but annihilating the wicked, offering resurrection as the true hope for the dead. This truth exposes false religion’s scare tactics, affirming Jehovah’s love and fairness in dealing with sin and its consequences.</p>

The Bible calls for separation from such traditions, urging worshipers to honor Jehovah through His appointed means, like the Memorial of Christ’s death.

Unlike false teachings that deify it, the Bible portrays the spirit as a tool under Jehovah’s control, poured out to guide and sanctify His people. This truth clarifies God’s nature and His means of interacting with humanity, distinct from pagan concepts.</p>

                    <p>Pride is the haughty self-exaltation Jehovah hates, a root of sin that defies His rule and leads to ruin, as with Satan’s fall. It blinds people to truth, fostering division and rebellion, unlike the humility God honors. The Bible warns it precedes a fall, seen in history’s proud kings like Nebuchadnezzar.

                    <p>The Trinity—God as three persons in one—is a false doctrine absent from the Bible, a pagan twist adopted by apostate Christianity. Jehovah is one, not three, supreme over Jesus His Son and the holy spirit His force. Scripture shows Jesus praying to and obeying God, proving distinction, not equality. Rejecting this lie honors Jehovah’s sole sovereignty, aligning with truth for His new world.</p>
