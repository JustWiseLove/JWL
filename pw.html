            <h2>Acknowledged By God</h2>
            <p>In 2006, construction started on a 31-story building on Padre Island, Texas. It was claimed to have sweeping views of the Gulf of Mexico with country condos. But just two years into the construction, work was halted when inspectors saw that concrete was cracking, the building began to lean, and it sunk 14 inches into the soil. Eventually, it had to be demolished. What was the problem? The foundation was not deep enough to support the weight of that building. For a building to stand the test of time and weather the elements, the foundation must be firm, solid, and deep.</p>
            <p>The same is true with us as true Christians. Our foundation of faith must be deep and strong to endure the storms of this system of things and stand the test of time. But what is our foundation of faith? The Apostle Paul answers that question very succinctly for us in <span class="scripture">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>: “For no one can lay any other foundation than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” (NWT) That seems obvious. As true Christians, Jesus Christ is the foundation of our faith. We must believe that he is the Messiah, the anointed one of God, that he is serving as head of the congregation, and that he is the king of God’s kingdom.</p>
            <p>But just knowing that on the surface is not enough; our trust and faith in Jesus as the Messiah must be deep. Trust and faith are not something that is automatic; they are developed over time. To illustrate, if you need someone to babysit your children for a few days, do you just go to Craigslist and choose the first stranger that pops up at the top of the list? We hope not. You would find someone who has demonstrated their trustworthiness, reliability, and uprightness over a period of time. It takes time to develop that level of trust.</p>
            <p>How can we develop that unbreakable trust and confidence in Jesus? The Apostle Paul again gives us the keys in <span class="scripture">2 Corinthians 1:20</span>: “For no matter how many the promises of God are, they have become Yes by means of him.” (NWT) By means of the things that Jesus taught, did, and fulfilled as a ransom, all of God’s promises in the Scriptures are confirmed. As we examine each Messianic prophecy, it’s like a string that on its own may break, but as we examine more prophecies, they become like strands intertwined to form an unbreakable rope of trust in Jesus as the Messiah and in all of God’s promises, including the destruction of the wicked, the restoration of the earth to paradise, the resurrection of the dead, and more.</p>
            <p>How important it is that we take the time to examine these Messianic prophecies and see their fulfillment. Last year, we had an opportunity to begin this process with the “Good News According to Jesus” video, episode one. Numerous Messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus, revealing him as the promised Messiah. For example, <span class="scripture">Luke 1:13-35</span> and <span class="scripture">Matthew 2:1-15</span> highlight prophecies about his birth and early life. This year, we consider six more Messianic prophecies, three today and three tomorrow, answering: What was prophesied? How was it fulfilled? Why is the fulfillment remarkable?</p>
            <p>Let’s begin with the prophecy of the Messiah being acknowledged by God. <span class="scripture">Psalm 2:7</span> states: “Let me proclaim the decree of Jehovah; He said to me: ‘You are my son; Today I have become your father.’” (NWT) This prophecy, written over a thousand years before Jesus’ baptism, foretold that Jehovah would publicly declare Jesus as His Son and King. <span class="scripture">Isaiah 42:1</span> adds: “Look! My servant, whom I support, my chosen one, whom I have approved. I have put my spirit in him; he will bring justice to the nations.” (NWT) Jehovah would acknowledge Jesus in three ways: expressing support, approval, and placing His spirit on him.</p>
            <p>How was this fulfilled? <span class="scripture">Matthew 3:16-17</span> records: “After being baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water; and look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw God’s spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him. Look! Also, a voice from the heavens said: ‘This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.’” (NWT) Jehovah clearly acknowledged Jesus, expressing support and approval, and placing His spirit on him. Two and a half years later, at the transfiguration (<span class="scripture">Matthew 17:5</span>), a voice from a cloud said: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved. Listen to him.” (NWT)</p>
            <p>Why is this remarkable? <span class="scripture">Acts 7:53</span> notes that the Mosaic Law was transmitted by angels, but at Jesus’ baptism, Jehovah’s voice was heard directly, a rare event. <span class="scripture">John 1:32-34</span> records John the Baptist’s witness: “I viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him... This is the one who baptizes with holy spirit. And I have seen it and have given witness that this one is the Son of God.” (NWT) Most remarkably, <span class="scripture">Acts 13:33-34</span> states: “God has completely fulfilled it to us, their children, by resurrecting Jesus; just as it is written in the second Psalm: ‘You are my son; today I have become your father.’” (NWT) Jehovah’s resurrection of Jesus, witnessed by over 500 people, was the greatest act of power, confirming Jesus as the Messiah.</p>
            <p>We have the privilege of testifying to this overwhelming evidence that Jesus is the Messiah and announcing God’s decree that he is the King of God’s Kingdom through our preaching work. May meditating on this prophecy strengthen our foundation of faith.</p>

            <h2>Descended From King David</h2>
            <p>Have you ever wondered where your ancestors came from? Many have, with one popular genealogy website averaging over one billion searches annually. For most, this satisfies curiosity, but there is a genealogy of far greater importance. The Messianic prophecy foretold that the Messiah would descend from King David.</p>
            <p><span class="scripture">2 Samuel 7:12-13</span> states: “When your days come to an end and you are laid to rest with your forefathers, then I will raise up your offspring after you, your own son, and I will firmly establish his kingdom. He is the one who will build a house for my name, and I will firmly establish the throne of his kingdom forever.” (NWT) This prophecy, spoken to David through Nathan, promised that the Messiah would be a descendant of David, ruling forever. <span class="scripture">Genesis 22:18</span> adds: “And by means of your offspring all nations of the earth will obtain a blessing for themselves because you have listened to my voice.” (NWT) This points to Abraham’s line, including Isaac, Jacob, and Judah.</p>
            <p>Was this prophecy fulfilled? <span class="scripture">Matthew 1:1-6</span> records: “The book of the history of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham. Abraham became father to Isaac; Isaac became father to Jacob; Jacob became father to Judah and his brothers... Jesse became father to David the king; David became father to Solomon by the wife of Uriah.” (NWT) Matthew traces Jesus’ legal right to David’s throne through Solomon to Joseph, his adopted father. <span class="scripture">Luke 3:23-31</span> traces his natural descent through David’s son Nathan to Mary, stating: “When Jesus began his work, he was about 30 years old, being the son, as the opinion was, of Joseph, son of Heli.” (NWT)</p>
            <p>Why is this remarkable? Jesus’ genealogy was preserved over thousands of years, despite attempts to disrupt the Messianic line, such as in <span class="scripture">2 Kings</span>. Jewish records were lost during the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem around 600 BCE, yet Jesus’ lineage was preserved in public archives and widely acknowledged. Matthew and Luke’s detailed accounts, written for Jews and all people, respectively, confirm Jesus as the promised Messiah, fulfilling prophecies spanning from Adam to David. This gives us confidence that Jesus is the Messiah, appointed by Jehovah.</p>

        <section id="anointed">
            <h2>Anointed as “Messiah the Leader”</h2>
            <p><span class="scripture">Daniel 9:25</span> states: “You should know and understand that from the issuing of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be 7 weeks, also 62 weeks.” (NWT) This prophecy provided a measurable timeline for the Messiah’s arrival, significant for Jews expecting a leader to free God’s people.</p>
            <p>How was it fulfilled? <span class="scripture">Nehemiah 2:1-8</span> records the decree in 455 BCE, in the 20th year of King Artaxerxes, to rebuild Jerusalem. Nehemiah requested: “If it pleases the king, let letters be given me for the governors of the region beyond the River, granting me safe passage until I reach Judah, as well as a letter to Asaph the keeper of the royal park, so that he may give me timber for beams... for the walls of the city.” (NWT) The prophecy’s 69 weeks (483 years, applying <span class="scripture">Numbers 14:34</span>’s “day for a year” principle) point to 29 CE. <span class="scripture">Luke 3:1-2, 21-23</span> confirms: “In the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar... God’s declaration came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness... Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus too was baptized... When Jesus began his work, he was about 30 years old.” (NWT) Jesus was anointed as the Messiah in 29 CE, exactly as foretold.</p>
            <p>Why is this remarkable? Jehovah announced the Messiah’s arrival centuries in advance with precise timing. The decree to rebuild Jerusalem was fulfilled, and the city and temple were later destroyed as foretold in <span class="scripture">Daniel 9:26</span>. Despite opposition, Nehemiah’s work succeeded, showing Jehovah’s ability to fulfill His promises. The expectation of the Messiah was heightened by events like angels announcing Jesus’ birth (<span class="scripture">Luke 2:8-14</span>) and Simeon’s proclamation (<span class="scripture">Luke 2:25-32</span>). This strengthens our faith in Jehovah as the great timekeeper and in Jesus as the Messiah.</p>

            <h2>Who Really Rules the World?</h2>
            <p>Disease, crime, and poverty plague humanity despite advances in science and technology. Since 1945, over 250 conflicts have resulted in millions of deaths, and in 2025, an estimated 733 million people will go hungry despite sufficient global food production. Why do these problems persist? <span class="scripture">Luke 4:5-8</span> reveals: “So he brought him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time. And the Devil said to him: ‘I will give you all this authority and their glory, because it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. If you, therefore, do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.’ In reply Jesus said to him: ‘It is written, “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”’” (NWT) Jesus did not dispute Satan’s temporary authority, gained through Adam and Eve’s rebellion.</p>
            <p>How does Satan use his authority? <span class="scripture">Ephesians 2:2</span> describes him as “the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.” (NWT) Satan influences people’s thinking through lies like nationalism and tribalism, fostering division and hatred. He pressures individuals to compromise, as he did with Jesus, seeking just one act of worship.</p>
            <p>How should we view human governments? <span class="scripture">Romans 13:1</span> states: “Let every person be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God.” (NWT) Governments maintain order, and we respect them by obeying laws and paying taxes, but we remain neutral, as Jesus’ kingdom is “no part of this world” (<span class="scripture">John 18:36</span>). Jehovah can influence rulers for His purpose (<span class="scripture">Proverbs 21:1</span>), and some, like Cornelius and Sergius Paulus, responded to the truth.</p>
            <p>How do we carry on pure worship? Jesus taught two principles: <span class="scripture">Mark 12:17</span>: “Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.” (NWT) We give Jehovah exclusive devotion, as <span class="scripture">Revelation 4:11</span> states: “You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power.” (NWT) We avoid compromising acts like saluting flags or joining political causes. Examples like Herbert Senior, who faced imprisonment in 1916, and Carrie Lewis, who endured persecution in 1940, show steadfastness in maintaining neutrality.</p>
            <p>Satan’s rule is temporary, and Jesus foretold that he will soon be cast out. By remaining loyal to Jehovah, we uphold pure worship and strengthen our faith in His promises.</p>
