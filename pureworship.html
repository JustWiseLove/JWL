                <h2>Acknowledged By God</h2>
                <p class="hidden">In 2006, construction started on a 31-story building on Padre Island, Texas. The building was intended to have sweeping views of the Gulf of Mexico with country condos. But just two years into the construction, work was halted when inspectors saw concrete cracking, the building began to lean, and it sunk 14 inches into the soil. Eventually, it had to be demolished. The problem? The foundation was not deep enough to support the weight of the building. For a building to stand the test of time and weather the elements, the foundation must be firm, solid, and deep.</p>
                <p class="hidden">The same is true for us as true Christians. Our foundation of faith must be deep and strong to endure the storms of this system of things and stand the test of time. But what is our foundation of faith? The Apostle Paul answers succinctly in <span class="scripture">1 Corinthians 3:11</span>: “For no one can lay any other foundation than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” (NWT) As true Christians, Jesus Christ is the foundation of our faith. We must believe that he is the Messiah, the anointed one of God, that he is serving as head of the congregation, and that he is the king of God’s kingdom.</p>
                <p class="hidden">However, just knowing this on the surface is not enough; our trust and faith in Jesus as the Messiah must be deep. Trust and faith are not automatic; they develop over time. To illustrate, if you need someone to babysit your children for a few days, do you choose a stranger from Craigslist? Hopefully not. You would choose someone who has demonstrated trustworthiness, reliability, and uprightness over time. Developing that level of trust takes time.</p>
                <p class="hidden">How can we develop unbreakable trust and confidence in Jesus? The Apostle Paul gives us the key in <span class="scripture">2 Corinthians 1:20</span>: “For no matter how many the promises of God are, they have become Yes by means of him.” (NWT) Paul is saying that through Jesus’ teachings, actions, and sacrifice, all of God’s promises are confirmed. As we examine Messianic prophecies, each one is like a strand that, when intertwined, forms an unbreakable rope of trust in Jesus as the Messiah and in all of God’s promises, including the destruction of the wicked, the restoration of paradise, and the resurrection of the dead.</p>
                <p class="hidden">It’s vital to examine these Messianic prophecies and their fulfillment. Last year, we began this process with “Good News According to Jesus” episode one, which highlighted fulfilled prophecies. Please watch the following video review: Numerous Messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus, revealing the promised Messiah. “Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John. Holy spirit will come upon you, and for that reason the one born will be called God’s Son.” (<span class="scripture">Luke 1:13, 35</span>) “Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of David’s city, which is called Bethlehem... Jehovah’s angel appeared to Joseph in a dream... So Joseph got up and took the young child and the child’s mother and went into Egypt... And he came and settled in a city named Nazareth, in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets: ‘He will be called a Nazarene.’” (<span class="scripture">Matthew 2:1-15, 23</span>) “The true light that gives light to every sort of man was about to come into the world.” (<span class="scripture">John 1:9</span>)</p>
                <p class="hidden">This year, we’ll consider six more Messianic prophecies—three today and three tomorrow. For each, we’ll answer three questions like detectives: What was prophesied? How was it fulfilled? Why is the fulfillment remarkable? This process strengthens our foundation of faith.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Let’s begin with the first prophecy: the Messiah being acknowledged by God. Watch the following video, then we’ll answer what was prophesied and how it was fulfilled: “At that moment the heavens were opened up, and he saw God’s spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him. Look! Also, a voice from the heavens said: ‘This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.’” (<span class="scripture">Matthew 3:16-17</span>)</p>
                <p class="hidden">What was prophesied? Turn to <span class="scripture">Psalm 2:7</span>, written by King David over a thousand years before Jesus’ baptism: “Let me proclaim the decree of Jehovah; He said to me: ‘You are my son; Today I have become your father.’” (NWT) This prophesied Jehovah’s public declaration of Jesus as His Son and King of His Kingdom.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Another prophecy in <span class="scripture">Isaiah 42:1</span> adds details: “Look! My servant, whom I support, my chosen one, whom I have approved. I have put my spirit in him; he will bring justice to the nations.” (NWT) Jehovah would acknowledge His Son by expressing support, approval, and placing His spirit on him.</p>
                <p class="hidden">How were these prophecies fulfilled? <span class="scripture">Matthew 3:16-17</span> records: “After being baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water; and look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw God’s spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him. Look! Also, a voice from the heavens said: ‘This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.’” (NWT) Jehovah clearly acknowledged Jesus, expressing love and approval, and placing His spirit on him as a dove, enabling Jesus to recall his prehuman existence.</p>
                <p class="hidden">This acknowledgment wasn’t limited to Jesus’ baptism. At the transfiguration, <span class="scripture">Matthew 17:5</span> records a voice from a cloud: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved. Listen to him.” (NWT) Additionally, <span class="scripture">Acts 13:33-34</span> confirms Jehovah’s decree through Jesus’ resurrection: “God has completely fulfilled it to us, their children, by resurrecting Jesus; just as it is written in the second Psalm: ‘You are my son; today I have become your father.’” (NWT)</p>
                <p class="hidden">Why is this fulfillment remarkable? At Jesus’ baptism, Jehovah’s voice was likely heard directly for the first time, as <span class="scripture">Acts 7:53</span> notes the Mosaic Law was transmitted by angels. <span class="scripture">John 1:32-34</span> records John the Baptist’s witness: “I viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him... this is the one who baptizes with holy spirit.” (NWT) Only Jesus and John heard Jehovah’s voice and saw the spirit, marking a shift in true worship. Most remarkably, Jesus’ resurrection to spirit life, witnessed by over 500, was Jehovah’s greatest act of power, confirming Jesus as the Messiah.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Dear friends, we have the privilege of testifying to Jesus as the Messiah and God’s appointed King through our preaching work. Meditating on this prophecy strengthens our foundation of faith, ensuring it remains unshakable as we await the fulfillment of all God’s promises through Jesus.</p>

            <section id="descended">
                <h2>Descended From King David</h2>
                <p class="hidden">Have you ever wondered about your ancestors? Many do, with genealogy websites averaging over one billion searches annually. While this satisfies curiosity, a genealogy of far greater importance fulfills prophecy crucial to mankind’s future. Watch this excerpt from “Good News According to Jesus”: “Son of David, Son of Isaac, Son of Abraham, Son of Shem, Son of Noah, Son of God.” This reminds us of David’s career and the prophecy that the Messiah would descend from his line.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Examine <span class="scripture">2 Samuel 7:12-13</span>: “When your days come to an end and you are laid to rest with your forefathers, then I will raise up your offspring after you, your own son, and I will firmly establish his kingdom. He is the one who will build a house for my name, and I will firmly establish the throne of his kingdom forever.” (NWT) Jehovah revealed that the Messiah would be a descendant of King David, ruling forever.</p>
                <p class="hidden">This prophecy, reiterated in <span class="scripture">Genesis 22:18</span>, promised: “And by means of your offspring all nations of the earth will obtain a blessing for themselves because you have listened to my voice.” (NWT) The Messiah would descend from Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Judah, blessing all nations.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Was this fulfilled? <span class="scripture">Matthew 1:1-6</span> states: “The book of the history of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham. Abraham became father to Isaac; Isaac became father to Jacob; Jacob became father to Judah and his brothers... Jesse became father to David the king; David became father to Solomon by the wife of Uriah.” (NWT) Matthew traces Jesus’ lineage from David through Solomon to Joseph, his adopted father, proving his legal right to David’s kingship.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Luke’s account in <span class="scripture">Luke 3:23</span> traces Jesus’ natural descent through David’s son Nathan to Mary: “When Jesus began his work, he was about 30 years old, being the son, as the opinion was, of Joseph, son of Heli.” (NWT) Heli, Mary’s father, connects Jesus’ bloodline to David. Luke extends the genealogy to Adam, emphasizing Jesus as the Messiah for all people.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Watch this video outlining Jesus’ ancestry: “Thousands of years before Jesus’ birth, Messianic prophecy beginning with <span class="scripture">Genesis 3:15</span> foretold his role as the Messiah. Matthew and Luke provided genealogies tracing Jesus’ lineage from Adam to Abraham, through whom God promised the Messiah would descend. The Messiah would descend through King David. Luke traces Jesus’ natural descent through Nathan to Mary, while Matthew traces his legal right through Solomon to Joseph.”</p>
                <p class="hidden">This prophecy’s fulfillment is remarkable for its accuracy and detail. Jesus likely recalled his ancestry upon anointing, tracing over 40 generations. Opposers tried to cut off the Messianic line, but Jehovah preserved it (<span class="scripture">2 Kings</span>). Jewish records were lost in Jerusalem’s destruction in 70 CE, yet Jesus’ genealogy was preserved, proving his descent from David and fulfilling prophecy.</p>
                <p class="hidden">While curiosity about our ancestors is normal, Jesus’ genealogy leaves no doubt he is the Messiah, descended from King David. May we submit to Jesus’ rule, the champion of pure worship, with credentials proving Jehovah’s appointment.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="anointed">
                <h2>Anointed as “Messiah the Leader”</h2>
                <p class="hidden">This symposium concludes with evidence that Jesus fulfilled the role of Messiah, the Leader. <span class="scripture">Daniel 9:25</span> states: “You should know and understand that from the issuing of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be 7 weeks, also 62 weeks.” (NWT) This prophecy provided measurable evidence for Jews to anticipate the Messiah’s arrival.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Why was this important? The Messiah would lead and free God’s people, a promise relevant to us today. To understand fulfillment, we need the prophecy’s start, duration, and end. <span class="scripture">Nehemiah 2:7</span> records Nehemiah’s request to King Artaxerxes: “Let letters be given me for the governors... granting me safe passage until I reach Judah, as well as a letter to Asaph... for timber for beams for the gates... and for the walls of the city.” (NWT) This decree in 455 BCE, Artaxerxes’ 20th year, marked the start.</p>
                <p class="hidden">The duration was 69 weeks, or 483 days. Applying <span class="scripture">Numbers 14:34</span>’s day-for-a-year principle, 483 years from 455 BCE brings us to 29 CE. <span class="scripture">Luke 3:1-2, 21-23</span> confirms: “In the 15th year of Tiberius Caesar... Jesus too was baptized... about 30 years old.” (NWT) In 29 CE, Jesus was anointed, receiving God’s spirit, fulfilling the prophecy.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Watch this video summarizing the prophecy: “More than 500 years before Jesus’ birth, Gabriel revealed the Messiah’s arrival to Daniel: ‘From the issuing of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be 7 weeks, also 62 weeks.’ Applying a day for a year, 483 years from 455 BCE brings us to 29 CE, when Jesus was baptized and anointed.”</p>
                <p class="hidden">This fulfillment is remarkable because Jehovah foretold the exact timing centuries in advance. <span class="scripture">Daniel 9:26</span> predicted Jerusalem’s destruction after the Messiah’s death, which occurred in 70 CE. Despite opposition, the prophecy was fulfilled, strengthening our faith in Jehovah as the great timekeeper.</p>
                <p class="hidden">By following Jesus as our Leader, we share in this prophecy’s fulfillment. Part two of this symposium tomorrow will explore three more prophecies proving Jesus’ role as the Messianic King and Leader.</p>

            <section id="rules">
                <h2>Who Really Rules the World?</h2>
                <p class="hidden">Disease, crime, and poverty plague humanity. Despite experiments with monarchies, democracies, and other governments, problems persist. Since 1945, over 250 conflicts have caused millions of deaths. Despite producing enough food globally, 733 million people will go hungry in 2025. Why do human solutions fail?</p>
                <p class="hidden">After Jesus’ baptism, Satan tempted him, as recorded in <span class="scripture">Luke 4:5-8</span>: “So he brought him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth... And the Devil said to him: ‘I will give you all this authority and their glory, because it has been handed over to me... If you, therefore, do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.’ In reply Jesus said to him: ‘It is written, “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”’” (NWT) Satan claimed authority over human governments, a claim Jesus did not dispute, affirming Satan’s temporary rule since Adam and Eve’s rebellion.</p>
                <p class="hidden">How does Satan use his authority? He influences thinking and conduct through the world’s atmosphere, as <span class="scripture">Ephesians 2:2</span> states: “according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.” (NWT) Satan promotes lies like nationalism and racism, pressuring people to act selfishly.</p>
                <p class="hidden">How should we view human governments? <span class="scripture">Romans 13:1</span> advises: “Let every person be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God.” (NWT) Governments maintain order, and we obey laws and pay taxes, benefiting from services. However, we remain neutral, avoiding political involvement, as Jesus taught in <span class="scripture">John 18:36</span>: “My Kingdom is no part of this world.” (NWT)</p>
                <p class="hidden">To carry on pure worship, we follow Jesus’ principles. <span class="scripture">Mark 12:17</span> says: “Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.” (NWT) Jehovah deserves our devotion, as <span class="scripture">Revelation 4:11</span> states. <span class="scripture">Romans 14:8</span> adds: “For if we live, we live to Jehovah, and if we die, we die to Jehovah.” (NWT) We avoid compromising acts and maintain neutrality, filtering out biased influences to focus on Jehovah’s Kingdom.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Watch this video showing Jehovah’s Witnesses’ loyalty: “In 1916, Herbert Senior refused military service... In 1940, Carrie Lewis declined to salute the flag... In 1967, Malawian Witnesses faced persecution for refusing political party cards.” These examples, with Jesus’ resolve, inspire us to worship only Jehovah, trusting He will soon end Satan’s rule.</p>

            <section id="live">
                <h2>Live On Jehovah’s Word</h2>
                <p class="hidden">Every servant of God has been, is, or will be tempted, including Jesus, the perfect Son of God. A temptation is an attraction to something, especially something wrong. Satan continues to tempt Jehovah’s worshipers to act contrary to God’s will. How can we resist? By imitating Jesus’ response. This symposium considers four points: how Satan tempted Jesus, how Jesus responded resolutely, how Satan tempts us today, and how we can imitate Jesus’ responses.</p>
                <p class="hidden"><span class="scripture">Matthew 4:1-3</span> states: “Then Jesus was led by the Spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil. After he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights, he felt hungry. And the Tempter came and said to him: ‘If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.’” (NWT) Jesus was alone, hungry, and vulnerable, yet only Jehovah and Satan saw his response. Temptations often occur when we think no one is watching.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Satan targeted Jesus’ hunger, not offering gold but bread, something Jesus craved. Natural desires, like hunger, are powerful. Satan suggested doubt: if Jehovah loved Jesus, why was he hungry? Jesus responded in <span class="scripture">Matthew 4:4</span>: “It is written: ‘Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every word that comes from Jehovah’s mouth.’” (NWT) Jesus quoted scripture, likely meditating on Deuteronomy during his fast, trusting Jehovah to provide.</p>
                <p class="hidden">A Watchtower publication suggests Jehovah may have reassured Jesus: “My dearest precious son, I love you more than anyone... My power is unlimited.” Jesus trusted Jehovah’s provision, not taking matters into his own hands. The Hebrew term in <span class="scripture">Deuteronomy 8:3</span> for “he causes to become” reminded Jesus of Jehovah’s unlimited capacity.</p>
                <p class="hidden">How does Satan tempt us today? <span class="scripture">1 Corinthians 7:3, 5</span> says: “Let the husband render to his wife her due... Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent... so that Satan may not keep tempting you for your lack of self-control.” (NWT) Sexual relations are natural, but Satan exploits these desires through media like pornography, encouraging illicit satisfaction.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Watch this dramatization: A brother, tempted by inappropriate images, recalls Jesus’ words: “Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every word that comes from Jehovah’s mouth.” He rejects the temptation, protecting his relationship with Jehovah. Like Jesus, we must resist when vulnerable, using scripture to strengthen our resolve.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Satan targets us when weak, tired, or stressed, exploiting natural desires. Like an eagle feeding its chicks, Jehovah provides sustenance through His Word. May we trust Him, draw near, and live forever by feeding on His Word.</p>

            <section id="test">
                <h2>Don’t Test Jehovah</h2>
                <p class="hidden">Why would Satan try to get us to test Jehovah? He succeeded with the Israelites, so he tried with Jesus. <span class="scripture">Matthew 4:5-6</span> records: “Then the Devil took him along into the holy city, and he stationed him on the battlement of the temple and said to him: ‘If you are a son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: “He will give his angels a command concerning you, and they will carry you on their hands so that you might not strike your foot against a stone.”’” (NWT) Satan misapplied <span class="scripture">Psalm 91:11-12</span>, suggesting Jehovah would protect Jesus regardless.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Satan’s goal was to provoke Jesus into a showy display, prioritizing reputation over Jehovah’s will. <span class="scripture">Isaiah 42:2</span> prophesied the Messiah would not “cry out or raise his voice.” Jesus responded in <span class="scripture">Matthew 4:7</span>: “It is written: ‘You must not put Jehovah your God to the test.’” (NWT) Quoting <span class="scripture">Deuteronomy 6:16</span>, Jesus recalled the Israelites’ error in demanding water, questioning Jehovah’s presence.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Jesus refused to demand miraculous protection, avoided misapplying scripture, and did not debate Satan. Satan tempts us to test Jehovah by: (1) engaging in reckless behavior, risking physical life; (2) choosing unwholesome entertainment or associations, endangering spirituality; (3) seeking undue attention via social media.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Watch this dramatization: A sister, tempted to post a selfie for attention, recalls: “You must not put Jehovah your God to the test.” She focuses on Jehovah’s promises, avoiding self-centered actions. Like Jesus, we must reject Satan’s attempts to test Jehovah, remaining obedient and trusting in His protection.</p>

                <h2>Worship Only Jehovah</h2>
                <p class="hidden">Tempting offers often come with a catch. Satan showed Jesus all the kingdoms in <span class="scripture">Luke 4:5-7</span>: “I will give you all this authority and their glory... If you, therefore, do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.” (NWT) Satan offered instant rule without suffering, appealing to Jesus’ eyes and pride, requiring just one act of worship.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Jesus responded immediately in <span class="scripture">Matthew 4:10</span>: “Go away, Satan! For it is written: ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.’” (NWT) Quoting <span class="scripture">Deuteronomy 6:13</span>, Jesus showed undivided loyalty, dismissing Satan authoritatively.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Satan tempts us with materialistic attractions, urging us to abandon self-sacrifice for comfort. Watch this dramatization: A young brother, tempted to pursue a lucrative career over Bethel service, recalls Jesus’ focus on Jehovah’s will. He submits his Bethel application, prioritizing Kingdom interests.</p>
                <p class="hidden">A self-sacrificing life requires planning, prayer, and reliance on Jehovah. We must reject Satan’s offers, focusing on Jehovah’s promises, and give exclusive devotion to Him, just as Jesus did.</p>

                <h2>Defend The Truth</h2>
                <p class="hidden">Satan, the original apostate, opposes truth. He uses this world’s media, entertainment, and apostates to infect our faith, as <span class="scripture">2 Timothy 2:17</span> compares to gangrene. <span class="scripture">Luke 4:13</span> warns he strikes at convenient times, when we’re tired, stressed, or complacent.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Jesus defended the truth in <span class="scripture">Matthew 4:1-11</span> by: (1) using Jehovah’s name, strengthening resolve; (2) citing and applying scripture correctly; (3) ending confrontation with “Go away, Satan.” Watch this dramatization: A brother, faced with apostate material, refuses to engage, saying, “There’s only one truth, and it comes from Jehovah,” and walks away.</p>
                <p class="hidden">When sincere individuals have questions, even if influenced by apostate ideas, we can defend the truth lovingly using scripture, as <span class="scripture">1 Peter 3:15</span> advises: “Always ready to make a defense... with mildness and deep respect.” (NWT) Helping a struggling believer or answering sincere questions strengthens faith.</p>
                <p class="hidden">This symposium emphasizes: (1) live on Jehovah’s Word, (2) don’t test Jehovah, (3) worship only Jehovah, (4) defend the truth. Let’s pray for strength to never be silent in defending the truth, imitating Jesus’ resolute example.</p>

                <h2>What Does Jesus See In You?</h2>
                <p class="hidden">Jesus is “especially fond of the sons of men,” showing love and affection. <span class="scripture">Isaiah 11:2-4</span> foretold he would judge righteously, seeing our hearts, emotions, and feelings. <span class="scripture">John 2:25</span> confirms: “He knew what was in man.” (NWT) Jesus discerned the thoughts of Pharisees without them speaking, a comforting ability ensuring fair judgment.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Consider Matthew the tax collector. <span class="scripture">Matthew 9:9</span> records: “Jesus caught sight of a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: ‘Be my follower.’ At that he rose up and followed him.” (NWT) Despite tax collectors’ bad reputation, Matthew responded immediately, showing modesty by openly admitting his past in his gospel, unlike Mark and Luke.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector, climbed a tree to see Jesus (<span class="scripture">Luke 19:1-4</span>). After dining with Jesus, he vowed to restore fourfold what he extorted and give half his belongings to the poor. <span class="scripture">Luke 19:9-10</span> says: “Today, salvation has come to this house... For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.” (NWT) Jesus saw Zacchaeus’ sincere heart.</p>
                <p class="hidden">A Samaritan woman, living immorally, met Jesus at a well (<span class="scripture">John 4:7, 16-18</span>). Jesus revealed her past, yet she humbly recognized him as a prophet, leading her village to him. Jesus saw her humility and faith, spending two days teaching Samaritans.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Saul of Tarsus, a persecutor, was called a “chosen vessel” by Jesus (<span class="scripture">Acts 9</span>). Despite his past, Jesus saw his potential, and Paul’s 14 letters reflect his love and dedication. Jesus sees good in us today—love, faith, and zeal—using us to preach the good news.</p>
                <p class="hidden"><span class="scripture">1 Peter 4:10</span> encourages: “To the extent that each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another.” (NWT) Jesus sees our potential, even if we feel inadequate. Watch this video: Brenda and Fermin, despite feeling unworthy, served faithfully, trusting Jesus’ view of their qualities.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Don’t compare yourself to others or judge them. <span class="scripture">Mark 10:43-44</span> says: “Whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister, and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all.” (NWT) Trust Jehovah to use you, as Jesus sees your potential for greater service now and in the future.</p>
