                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>The Bible stands as Jehovah’s unshakable truth—written by honest men, proven by history and science, and enduring all attacks. Why trust it?</p>
                    <p><strong>Men Moved by God:</strong> Over 40 writers across 1,600 years—fishermen, kings, prophets—wrote as one under Jehovah’s spirit (2 Peter 1:21), baring their flaws (Exodus 4:10, Psalm 51).</p>
                    <p class="scripture">“All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial…” <cite>—2 Timothy 3:16</cite></p>
                    <p><strong>Science Confirms It:</strong> The earth hangs “upon nothing” (Job 26:7), is a “circle” (Isaiah 40:22), and blood is life (Leviticus 17:11)—facts ahead of human discovery.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">“Your word is truth.” <cite>—John 17:17</cite></p>
                    <p><strong>History Proves It:</strong> Sennacherib’s Prism (2 Kings 18-19), the Pilate Stone (John 19:13), and the Dead Sea Scrolls (Isaiah 40:8) affirm its accuracy.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">“The word of our God endures forever.” <cite>—Isaiah 40:8</cite></p>
                    <p><strong>The Only Lasting Path:</strong> Wealth and fame fail (Ecclesiastes 5:10), but knowing Jehovah brings life (John 17:3) through study and prayer.</p>
                    <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you…” <cite>—John 17:3</cite></p>
                    <p><strong>Unshaken by Time:</strong> Burned, banned, yet thriving in 3,000+ languages, its purity holds (Psalm 12:6; Isaiah 55:11).</p>
                    <p class="scripture">“The word of Jehovah endures forever.” <cite>—1 Peter 1:25</cite></p>
                    <p>Jehovah’s Word outlasts all—trust it over human lies!</p>

              <summary class="card-header">1. Why Study the Bible?</summary>
              <div class="card-content">
                  <p>The Bible stands as Jehovah’s inspired Word, a divine gift distinct from human philosophies or religious texts rooted in false worship, such as pagan myths or materialistic ideologies. It reveals God’s will and purpose for humanity, offering guidance for life’s challenges, as affirmed by 2 Timothy 3:16: 'All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.' Historically, its preservation through centuries—despite attempts to suppress it—demonstrates divine protection. Scientifically, its references, like the earth’s suspension (Job 26:7), align with later discoveries, proving its reliability. Studying it equips us to reject false teachings, like idol worship or soul immortality, and fosters a relationship with Jehovah based on truth.</p>
                  <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Wisdom and protection from false teachings.</p>
                  <p class="scripture">2 Timothy 3:16 - “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.”</p>
                  <p class="scripture">Joshua 1:8 - “This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth, and you must read it in an undertone day and night, in order to act wisely and have success.”</p>
                  <p class="scripture">Psalm 119:105 - “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light for my path.”</p>
                  <p class="scripture">John 17:17 - “Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.”</p>

              <div class="card-content">
                  <p>The Bible was penned by over 40 human writers—kings, prophets, fishermen—spanning 1,600 years, yet its unity stems from Jehovah’s holy spirit, as 2 Peter 1:21 states: 'Men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.' Unlike pagan texts filled with contradictory myths, its consistent message across centuries proves divine authorship. Historically, its composition began with Moses around 1513 B.C.E. and concluded with John’s writings around 98 C.E., surviving persecution and translation into thousands of languages. Science supports its accuracy, such as the hydrologic cycle in Job 36:27-28, predating modern understanding. This refutes false worship’s claim of human origin, affirming Jehovah as its true Author.</p>
                  <p><strong>History:</strong> Unified over 1,600 years.</p>
                  <p class="scripture">2 Peter 1:21 - “For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.”</p>

              <summary class="card-header">3. Is the Bible Scientifically Accurate?</summary>
              <div class="card-content">
                  <p>The Bible’s scientific accuracy shines through statements made long before human discovery, such as Job 26:7: 'He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.' This aligns with the earth’s suspension in space, a fact unknown in ancient times. Unlike false worship’s flat-earth myths or Babylonian cosmologies, Isaiah 40:22 describes Jehovah as 'the One who dwells above the circle of the earth,' hinting at its spherical shape. Historically, its sanitation laws (Leviticus 11-15) predate germ theory, saving lives. These facts dismantle claims of inaccuracy, proving the Bible’s divine origin and its superiority over pagan falsehoods.</p>
                  <p><strong>Science:</strong> Earth’s shape and suspension.</p>
                  <p class="scripture">Job 26:7 - “He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.”</p>
                  <p class="scripture">Isaiah 40:22 - “It is he who sits above the circle of the earth.”</p>

              <div class="card-content">
                  <p>Jehovah, God’s personal name, appears over 7,000 times in the original texts, as Psalm 83:18 declares: 'You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.' False worship obscures this name with titles like 'Lord,' a practice rooted in superstition and tradition, not Scripture. Historically, the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) was revered by Israel, yet removed by later scribes influenced by pagan customs. Science offers no contradiction, but the Bible’s consistent use across millennia confirms its authenticity. Knowing Jehovah’s name sets true worship apart from the nameless deities of false religion.</p>
                  <p><strong>Origin:</strong> YHWH, often removed.</p>
                  <p class="scripture">Psalm 83:18 - “May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”</p>

              <div class="card-content">
                  <p>Jesus Christ is Jehovah’s firstborn Son, not God Almighty, as Colossians 1:15 states: 'He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.' False worship, like the Trinity doctrine from pagan triads, equates him with Jehovah, but Scripture distinguishes them. Historically, Jesus’ role as Messiah was foretold (Isaiah 9:6) and fulfilled in 29 C.E., initiating Christianity. Science aligns with his miracles, like healing, as acts of divine power, not myth. He’s the ransom and future King, refuting false claims of co-equality and affirming Jehovah’s supremacy in true worship.</p>
                  <p><strong>Role:</strong> Son and Savior.</p>

              <div class="card-content">
                  <p>The holy spirit is Jehovah’s active force, not a person, as Genesis 1:2 reveals: 'God’s active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.' False worship’s Trinity portrays it as a deity, borrowing from pagan trios like Egypt’s Osiris-Isis-Horus, but the Bible shows it as God’s power at work. Historically, it inspired prophets and empowered Jesus’ miracles (Luke 4:1). Scientifically, its effects—like creation’s order—suggest a purposeful force, not a random entity. Understanding this counters false teachings and honors Jehovah’s true nature.</p>

              <div class="card-content">
                  <p>Jehovah created the earth as a permanent home for humanity, as Isaiah 45:18 affirms: 'He is the One who formed the earth... who firmly established it, who did not create it simply for nothing, but formed it to be inhabited.' False worship teaches a temporary earth or soul ascension, echoing pagan afterlife myths, but the Bible promises an eternal paradise. Historically, Genesis records this purpose from creation’s start. Science supports an earth designed for life—its water, air, and ecosystems—refuting chance. This truth inspires hope in Jehovah’s original plan.</p>
                  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> A lasting home.</p>
                  <p class="scripture">Psalm 104:5 - “He has established the earth on its foundations; it will not be moved from its place forever and ever.”</p>

              <div class="card-content">
                  <p>Sin is any act or thought that misses Jehovah’s perfect standards, inherited from Adam, as Romans 3:23 states: 'All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.' False worship minimizes sin with rituals or excuses, like pagan sacrifices to appease gods, but the Bible calls it rebellion against Jehovah. Historically, sin entered through Adam’s disobedience in Eden (Genesis 3). Science shows human imperfection—disease and death—as sin’s effects, not evolution’s design. Recognizing sin’s gravity drives us to seek Jehovah’s forgiveness, not human solutions.</p>
                  <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Rebellion against God.</p>
                  <p class="scripture">Romans 3:23 - “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”</p>

                  <p class="scripture">James 4:17 - “Therefore, if someone knows how to do what is right and yet does not do it, it is a sin for him.”</p>
                  <p class="scripture">Psalm 51:5 - “Look! I was born guilty of error, and my mother conceived me in sin.”</p>

                  <p>Death results from sin, not Jehovah’s original intent, as Romans 5:12 explains: 'Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin.' False worship’s soul immortality, rooted in Babylonian and Greek myths, contradicts this, but the Bible promises death’s end (1 Corinthians 15:26). Historically, Adam’s sin in 4026 B.C.E. (per Bible chronology) introduced mortality. Science confirms death as universal, unlike false claims of eternal consciousness. Jehovah’s purpose to eliminate death offers hope beyond pagan lies.</p>
                  <p><strong>History:</strong> From Adam’s sin.</p>
                  <p class="scripture">Romans 5:12 - “That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned.”</p>

                  <p>The soul is the living person—body and breath—not an immortal entity, as Genesis 2:7 states: 'Jehovah God went on to form the man... and the man became a living soul.' False worship’s spirit survival, from Egyptian and Hindu beliefs, clashes with Ezekiel 18:4: 'The soul who sins is the one who will die.' Historically, this truth shaped Israel’s rejection of afterlife myths. Science shows life ceases without breath or blood, aligning with Scripture, not paganism. This clarifies Jehovah’s resurrection hope over false immortality.</p>
                  <p><strong>Science:</strong> Life ends without breath.</p>

                  <p>False worship defies Jehovah’s standards through idolatry and human traditions, as 1 John 5:21 warns: 'Guard yourselves from idols.' Unlike true worship, it includes pagan practices like statue veneration or polytheism, condemned in Exodus 20:4-5. Historically, Israel battled Canaanite idol worship, a struggle echoed today in religious syncretism. Science exposes idols as powerless—mere stone or wood—while the Bible’s God creates and sustains life. Rejecting false worship aligns us with Jehovah’s exclusive glory.</p>

                  <p>Prayer is personal communication with Jehovah, not rote chants or idol pleas, as Philippians 4:6 instructs: 'In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.' False worship uses repetitive formulas or intermediaries, like pagan priests, but Jesus taught direct access (John 16:23). Historically, faithful ones like Daniel prayed sincerely, not ritually. Science shows prayer’s calming effect, supporting its purpose in building faith. True prayer strengthens our bond with Jehovah, free of false traditions.</p>

                  <p>Faith is confident trust in Jehovah’s promises, not blind superstition, as Hebrews 11:6 states: 'Without faith it is impossible to please God well.' False worship relies on luck or omens, like Babylonian astrology, but Bible faith rests on evidence—fulfilled prophecies and creation’s design (Romans 2:20). Historically, Noah’s faith saved his family, a pattern for us. Science marvels at the universe’s order, bolstering faith in a purposeful Creator. Faith in Jehovah’s Word offers hope beyond pagan uncertainties.</p>

                  <p>Baptism is a public symbol of dedication to Jehovah, not a ritual for infants, as Acts 2:38 commands: 'Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.' False worship sprinkles babies, a tradition from pagan rites, but the Bible requires conscious faith and full immersion (Matthew 3:16). Historically, early Christians baptized believers, not newborns. Science shows immersion’s symbolism—death to sin, new life—mirrors natural cycles. Baptism marks true worshipers committed to Jehovah.</p>

False worship distorts love into lust or ritual, like pagan fertility cults, but the Bible defines it through sacrifice—Jesus’ death (John 3:16). Historically, early Christians showed love by sharing all things (Acts 2:44-45). Science links love to health, reflecting Jehovah’s design. True love honors Him, not worldly desires.</p>

           <p>God’s Kingdom is a heavenly government under Jesus Christ, destined to rule earth, as Daniel 2:44 promises: 'The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.' False worship trusts human rule or pagan deities, like Rome’s emperors, but the Bible foretells peace through Jehovah’s reign (Matthew 6:10).
