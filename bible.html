    <h2><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Jehovah Is the Only True God</h2>
    <div class="truth-content">
      <p>The Bible teaches that Jehovah alone is the true God, the Creator of all things. Unlike false religions that promote a trinity or multiple gods, Scripture clearly states that Jesus is not equal to Jehovah but is His Son, subordinate to Him. Jehovah’s unique name appears over 7,000 times in the Bible, emphasizing His supremacy. True worship must honor Jehovah alone, as He demands exclusive devotion. This is the truth Jehovah approves, and any teaching that elevates others to His level is false worship, leading to divine disapproval.</p>
      <div class="quote" data-tooltip="Jehovah’s name distinguishes Him as the sovereign God.">"You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth." — Psalm 83:18</div>

        False religions obscure Jehovah’s unique identity by replacing His name with generic titles like “Lord” or inventing a trinity doctrine. These practices dishonor the Creator, blending pagan concepts with worship, which Jehovah condemns as idolatry. Such teachings confuse followers, leading them away from the truth and into spiritual darkness, unfit for Jehovah’s approval.

    <h2><i class="fas fa-id-card-alt"></i> True Worship Must Be Pure</h2>
    <div class="truth-content">
      <p>The Bible teaches that true worshipers must worship Jehovah in spirit and truth, free from man-made traditions. Rituals like rosaries, incense, or holy water are not in Scripture and are unacceptable to Jehovah. True worship involves studying the Bible, obeying its commands, and living in harmony with Jehovah’s standards. Only worship based on biblical truth pleases Jehovah, as He rejects practices rooted in paganism or human invention. This is the truth Jehovah approves, and anything less is empty and futile in His eyes.</p>
      <div class="quote" data-tooltip="Jesus demands worship based on truth, not tradition.">"True worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth." — John 4:23</div>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-hammer"></i> Jesus Died on a Torture Stake</h2>
    <div class="truth-content">
      <p>The Bible teaches that Jesus was executed on a single upright stake, called a <em>stauros</em> in Greek, not a cross. The cross is a pagan symbol adopted centuries later to blend Christianity with sun worship. Historical evidence, including early Christian writings, confirms the use of a stake. Jehovah disapproves of using pagan symbols in worship, as they defile His truth. This is the truth Jehovah approves, and clinging to the cross distorts the sacrifice of Jesus and dishonors Jehovah’s standards for pure worship.</p>
      <div class="quote" data-tooltip="The Greek term <em>stauros</em> refers to a single stake.">"He carried the torture stake himself." — John 19:17</div>

        The cross, a pagan sun-worship symbol, was falsely adopted to merge Christianity with idolatry, defiling Jesus’ sacrifice. This deception misleads millions into venerating a pagan emblem, contrary to Jehovah’s command against images. Such false worship dishonors the truth and invites divine judgment, as it prioritizes tradition over Scripture.

    <h2><i class="fas fa-fire-alt"></i> Hellfire Does Not Exist</h2>
    <div class="truth-content">
      <p>The Bible teaches that the dead are unconscious, and Jehovah never intended to burn anyone. Hellfire is a false doctrine rooted in pagan beliefs, not Scripture. Jehovah explicitly stated that burning people never entered His mind, showing His loving nature. The dead await resurrection, not eternal torment. The soul that sins simply dies, not burns forever. This is the truth Jehovah approves, and teaching hellfire misrepresents His justice and love, leading to false worship that He rejects.</p>
      <div class="quote" data-tooltip="Jehovah rejects burning as punishment.">"To burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, something that I had not commanded and that had not come into my heart." — Jeremiah 7:31</div>

    <div class="truth-content">
      <p>The Bible teaches that Jehovah’s Kingdom is a literal government, established in heaven with Jesus as King since 1914, based on biblical prophecy. It will soon crush all human governments and transform the earth into a paradise. Unlike false teachings that call the Kingdom symbolic or internal, Daniel and Jesus confirm it as a divine rulership. This is the truth Jehovah approves, and praying for His Kingdom is central to true worship. Rejecting this truth leads to futile hopes in human systems, which Jehovah will destroy.</p>
      <div class="quote" data-tooltip="The Kingdom is a divine government, not a metaphor.">"In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed." — Daniel 2:44</div>

    <div class="truth-content">
      <p>The Bible teaches that exactly 144,000 faithful servants are chosen to rule with Christ in heaven as kings and priests. This limited group is distinct from the majority, who will live forever on a restored earth. Revelation clearly specifies this number, showing Jehovah’s precise plan. This is the truth Jehovah approves, and believing all go to heaven contradicts His purpose. True worship acknowledges this distinction, honoring Jehovah’s arrangement for heavenly and earthly hopes, which ensures His will is fulfilled.</p>
      <div class="quote" data-tooltip="A fixed number rule with Christ in heaven.">"I saw, and look! the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000." — Revelation 14:1</div>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Free Will, Not Fate, Guides Humans</h2>
    <div class="truth-content">
      <p>The Bible teaches that Jehovah grants humans free will to choose obedience or disobedience, not a predetermined fate. This freedom carries responsibility, as choices lead to life or death. Jehovah urges choosing life through obedience to His commands. Unlike false teachings of predestination, which deny accountability, the Bible emphasizes personal choice in worship. This is the truth Jehovah approves, and denying free will misrepresents His justice and undermines the purpose of His commands.</p>
      <div class="quote" data-tooltip="Humans choose their path, not a fixed fate.">"I have put life and death before you... choose life." — Deuteronomy 30:19</div>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-tint"></i> Blood Is Sacred to Jehovah</h2>
    <div class="truth-content">
      <p>The Bible teaches that blood represents life, which is sacred to Jehovah. He commands His worshipers to abstain from blood, whether in food or medical use. This reflects respect for His ownership of life. Historically, pagan practices misused blood in rituals, which Jehovah condemns. True worship obeys this command, as it is central to Jehovah’s standards. This is the truth Jehovah approves, and violating it defiles His worship. Ignoring this command shows disrespect for Jehovah’s authority over life.</p>
      <div class="quote" data-tooltip="Blood is sacred and must not be misused.">"You must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water." — Deuteronomy 12:16</div>

    <div class="truth-content">
      <p>The Bible teaches that true Christians must remain separate from worldly politics, conflicts, and customs. Jehovah demands exclusive devotion, and involvement in human governments or pagan practices defiles worship. Jesus set the example by rejecting worldly power. This is the truth Jehovah approves, and mixing with the world’s ways, such as voting or celebrating pagan holidays, contradicts His standards and invites His disapproval, as it compromises loyalty to Him.</p>
      <div class="quote" data-tooltip="True Christians avoid worldly entanglements.">"They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world." — John 17:16</div>

Jehovah demands exclusive devotion, and such acts violate His command against worshiping images or symbols. Historically, flag worship emerged from nationalistic fervor, not biblical faith. True worshipers honor only Jehovah and His Kingdom, rejecting patriotic rituals. This is the truth Jehovah approves, and participating in such acts defiles pure worship, as it places human creations above the Creator.</p>

The idea of an immortal soul comes from Greek philosophy, not Scripture. The dead are unconscious, awaiting resurrection. This is the truth Jehovah approves, and believing in an immortal soul distorts His purpose for resurrection and eternal life on earth.

False teachings claim the earth will burn, but Scripture promises a restored Eden. This is the truth Jehovah approves, and true worshipers hope in His promise to live forever on earth, not in heaven.

      <p>The Bible teaches that genuine love among Christians is the hallmark of true worship. Jesus said love would identify his followers, shown through self-sacrifice and unity. This love transcends race, nationality, and status, reflecting Jehovah’s own nature. Unlike divided religions, true worshipers display brotherly love, obeying Jehovah’s command.
