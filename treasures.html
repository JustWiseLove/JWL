                        <h2>(Pre-Flood Era, c. 4000–3000 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>The earliest faithful ones, like precious treasures, witnessed for Jehovah’s righteousness in a corrupt world, setting a pattern for true devotion, as “the righteous will be remembered forever” (Psalm 112:6).</p>
                        <p><strong>Abel:</strong> Adam’s son, Abel offered a sacrifice that pleased Jehovah, testifying to his faith through obedient worship (Genesis 4:4). Biblical accounts note his offering was “by faith,” earning divine approval (Hebrews 11:4). Murdered by Cain, Abel’s witness endures, as his blood “cries out” (Genesis 4:10), inspiring steadfastness in proclaiming Jehovah’s standards.</p>
                        <p><strong>Enoch:</strong> Enoch “walked with God,” boldly prophesying against wickedness (Jude 14-15). Biblical texts record his preaching of divine judgment, and Jehovah “took him” to spare him death (Genesis 5:24; Hebrews 11:5). His courage in a violent era models fearless declaration of Jehovah’s truth.</p>
                        <p><strong>Noah:</strong> A “preacher of righteousness” (2 Peter 2:5), Noah built the ark and warned of the Flood for 120 years (Genesis 6:3). Facing ridicule, he upheld Jehovah’s laws, saving his family (Hebrews 11:7). His witness, preserved in ancient Near Eastern flood accounts, shows unwavering loyalty to Jehovah.</p>
                        <h3>Lessons for Witnessing</h3>
                        <p>Abel’s faith, Enoch’s boldness, and Noah’s endurance teach that witnessing requires trust and perseverance. Families can discuss: How can we show faith like Abel in our daily choices? What bold actions can we take to share Jehovah’s truth like Enoch?</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain.” — Hebrews 11:4</p>

                        <p>Israel’s prophets, as treasured servants, proclaimed Jehovah’s name and laws, guiding His people to true worship, as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <p><strong>Moses:</strong> Raised in Egypt, Moses led Israel from slavery, receiving the Law at Sinai, which declared “Jehovah your God is one Jehovah” (Deuteronomy 6:4). He boldly proclaimed Jehovah’s name to Pharaoh (Exodus 3:15) and taught Israel to worship Him alone (Exodus 20:3). Biblical accounts record his intercession for Israel despite rebellion (Numbers 14:13-19), showing devotion to Jehovah’s purpose.</p>
                        <p><strong>Samuel:</strong> As prophet and judge, Samuel anointed Saul and David, calling Israel to exclusive devotion to Jehovah (1 Samuel 12:10-20). His preaching, preserved in Hebrew texts, strengthened true worship, urging the nation to “serve Jehovah with all your heart” (1 Samuel 12:24).</p>
                        <p><strong>Jeremiah:</strong> Jeremiah warned Judah of Babylon’s judgment, urging repentance (Jeremiah 7:2-7). Imprisoned and mocked, he declared “Jehovah is the true God” (Jeremiah 10:10). His scrolls, burned by King Jehoiakim, were rewritten (Jeremiah 36:32), testifying to Jehovah’s enduring word.</p>
                        <h3>Lessons for Witnessing</h3>
                        <p>Moses’ leadership, Samuel’s zeal, and Jeremiah’s perseverance show witnessing requires courage. Discuss: How can we proclaim Jehovah’s truth boldly like Jeremiah, even under pressure?</p>

                        <p><strong>Jesus Christ:</strong> Jesus declared “I have made your name known” (John 17:26), teaching Jehovah’s purpose through parables and miracles (Matthew 4:17). He preached publicly and house-to-house (Luke 8:1), enduring death on a stake to uphold Jehovah’s sovereignty (Philippians 2:8). Biblical accounts highlight his model for all witnesses.</p>
                        <p><strong>Peter:</strong> A leading apostle, Peter preached at Pentecost, declaring Jehovah’s resurrection of Jesus (Acts 2:32-36). Imprisoned and beaten, he continued witnessing (Acts 5:42), stating “we must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29). His epistles, in early manuscripts, urge faithfulness.</p>
                        <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Converted from persecutor, Paul traveled thousands of miles, establishing congregations and writing 14 epistles (Acts 9:15). Beheaded under Nero, his letters, preserved in biblical manuscripts, proclaim “Jehovah is my helper” (Hebrews 13:6).</p>
                        <h3>Lessons for Witnessing</h3>
                        <p>Jesus’ example, Peter’s boldness, and Paul’s endurance inspire modern preaching. Discuss: How can we imitate Jesus’ house-to-house ministry in our community?</p>

                        <p>Early Christians, like treasured gems, witnessed for Jehovah amid intense opposition, preserving His truth, as “be faithful even to death” (Revelation 2:10).</p>
                        <p><strong>Polycarp of Smyrna:</strong> A disciple of John, Polycarp refused to honor false gods, declaring, “I am a Christian.” Burned at the stake in 155 CE, his martyrdom, recorded in historical texts, upheld Jehovah’s worship, as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <p><strong>Justin Martyr:</strong> A philosopher-turned-Christian, Justin wrote *Apologies* defending Christianity, proclaiming Jehovah as the true God. Beheaded in 165 CE under Marcus Aurelius, his works, in historical archives, testified to Jehovah’s sovereignty.</p>

                        <p><strong>Waldensians:</strong> Led by Peter Waldo in the 12th century, the Waldensians translated vernacular Bibles, sharing Jehovah’s truth with the poor.

                        <p><strong>John Wycliffe:</strong> Wycliffe’s English Bible (1382) from the Latin Vulgate gave common people access to Jehovah’s Word.

                        <p><strong>Henry Grew:</strong> A Baptist minister, Grew taught “Jehovah” as God’s name and rejected false doctrines in the 1820s. His pamphlets, in historical archives, influenced later witnesses, as “the dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5).</p>
                        <p><strong>George Storrs:</strong> Storrs taught earthly resurrection and no immortal soul through *Six Sermons* in the 1840s. Persecuted, his writings, in the British Museum, London, reached thousands, as “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11).</p>

                        <h2>(Late 19th Century)</h2>
                        <p>Charles Taze Russell, a treasured servant, organized systematic witnessing, proclaiming Jehovah’s Kingdom, as “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p><strong>Charles Taze Russell:</strong> In 1870, Russell formed a Pittsburgh Bible study, rejecting false doctrines. Launching *Zion’s Watch Tower* in 1879, he published truth, distributing millions of tracts at churches and homes. His *Studies in the Scriptures* taught Jehovah’s purpose, and he founded the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society (1884). Calculating 1914 as Christ’s enthronement (Daniel 4:25, 607 BCE–1914), confirmed by World War I (Matthew 24:7), he faced opposition but persevered. His works, in the British Museum, London, restored Jehovah’s name, as “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10).</p>
                        <p><strong>Bible Students:</strong> Followers like Maria Ackley and Alexander Macmillan preached door-to-door, facing mob violence. Their conventions, like Cedar Point 1919, rallied thousands to proclaim Jehovah’s truth, as “declare his glory among the nations” (1 Chronicles 16:24).</p>

                        <p>Modern Witnesses, led by treasured figures, have globalized Jehovah’s truth, as “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p><strong>Joseph Franklin Rutherford:</strong> Succeeding Russell in 1917, Rutherford led amid World War I opposition. Jailed in 1918 with seven associates for publishing truth, he was released in 1919. Winning 43 Supreme Court cases, as historical records show, he secured preaching rights. Naming the group Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1931 (Isaiah 43:10), he used radio broadcasts and phonographs to share truth globally, as “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1).</p>
                        <p><strong>Nathan H. Knorr:</strong> From 1942, Knorr oversaw the New World Translation (1950–1961), restoring “Jehovah” 7,237 times. Founding Gilead School (1943), he trained missionaries for 240 lands. His leadership, in historical archives, expanded witnessing, as “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern Witnesses:</strong> With 8.7 million members, Witnesses preach in 1,000+ languages, logging 1.4 billion hours. Facing bans, like Russia’s 2017 ban with 2,000 arrests, they persevere, aiding disasters (e.g., Haiti 2010), as “Jehovah loves those who love him” (Psalm 31:23).</p>
