Launching *Zion’s Watch Tower* in 1879, he published truth, distributing millions of tracts.

                        <p><strong>Joseph Franklin Rutherford:</strong> Succeeding Russell in 1917, Rutherford led amid World War I opposition. Jailed in 1918 with seven associates for publishing truth, he was released in 1919. Winning 43 Supreme Court cases, as historical records show, he secured preaching rights.

                        <p><strong>Modern Witnesses:</strong> With 8.7 million members, Witnesses preach in 1,000+ languages, logging 1.4 billion hours. Facing bans, like Russia’s 2017 ban with 2,000 arrests, they persevere, aiding disasters like Haiti 2010, as “Jehovah loves those who love him” (Psalm 31:23).</p>
