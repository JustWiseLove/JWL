                        <h2>Satan’s Deception in Eden</h2>
                        <p>False worship ignited when Satan, as a serpent, deceived Eve into thinking she could be like God and judge right from wrong independently (Genesis 3:1-6), introducing idolatry by placing self or other gods above Jehovah, who demands sole devotion (Exodus 20:3). This rebellion spread to Cain, whose rejected sacrifice and murder of Abel defied Jehovah’s standards (Genesis 4:3-8). Sumerian tablets from 3000 BCE, listing gods like Enki with blood offerings, show polytheism’s rapid rise after Eden.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must not have any other gods besides me.” —Exodus 20:3</p>
                        <h2>The Golden Calf Incident</h2>
                        <p>Fresh from Egypt’s deliverance, the Israelites forged a golden calf, blending Jehovah’s worship with Egyptian bull god Apis practices, incurring about 3,000 deaths as punishment (Exodus 32:4-6, 28), a mix Deuteronomy 12:31 calls detestable. Hazor’s calf figurines from 1400 BCE confirm this idolatry’s spread. It warns against tainting Jehovah’s worship with human traditions.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Every detestable thing that Jehovah hates, they have done.” —Deuteronomy 12:31</p>
                        <h2>Baal Worship and Sacrifices</h2>
                        <p>Baal worship lured Israel into child sacrifice, an act Jehovah never imagined (Jeremiah 19:5), led by kings like Ahab with altars and poles (1 Kings 16:31-32), bringing ruin and judgment. Carthage urns from 800 BCE, holding diseased infant bones, show no blessing, only horror. This reveals Satan’s grip pulling people from Jehovah’s life-giving way.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They built the high places of Baal... to make their sons and daughters pass through the fire.” —Jeremiah 19:5</p>
                        <h2>Ancestor Worship’s Rise</h2>
                        <p>Ancestor worship defied Jehovah’s truth about death, with Egyptians mummifying pharaohs as gods by 2600 BCE, misreading Enoch (Genesis 5:24; Hebrews 11:13 says he died), and China’s Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE) consulting the dead via oracle bones, despite Ecclesiastes 9:5’s “the dead know nothing.” EEGs confirm consciousness ends at death, exposing this early falsehood.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all.” —Ecclesiastes 9:5</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Today’s False Practices</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Christmas and Paganism</h2>
                        <p>Christmas, pegged to December 25, stems from Saturnalia, a Roman sun god festival with feasts, gifts, and evergreens (Pliny, 77 CE), not Jesus’ birth—Luke 2:8’s shepherds suggest a warmer season—shunned by early Christians like Tertullian (200 CE) as pagan. Jehovah demands separation (2 Corinthians 6:17), yet trees and presents persist, echoing idolatry.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Get out from among them, and separate yourselves... and quit touching the unclean thing.” —2 Corinthians 6:17</p>
                        <h2>Easter’s Fertility Rites</h2>
                        <p>Easter mixes Jesus’ resurrection with Eostre’s fertility rites—eggs and rabbits from Saxon spring festivals (Bede, 725 CE)—unsupported by Scripture’s weekly meetings (Acts 20:7) or symbols, with Germanic rabbit icons from 500 CE predating Christianity. Jehovah rejects man-made worship (Matthew 15:9), yet egg hunts continue.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“In vain they worship me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.” —Matthew 15:9</p>
                        <h2>Halloween and Spiritism</h2>
                        <p>Halloween derives from Samhain, a Celtic dead-honoring festival banned as spiritism (Deuteronomy 18:10-12), with costumes and turnips from 900 CE Ireland, later tied to All Saints’ Day (835 CE). Leviticus 19:31 forbids spirit contact, yet trick-or-treating upholds this pagan rite.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“There should not be found in you anyone who... consults the dead.” —Deuteronomy 18:10-11</p>
                        <h2>Birthdays’ Pagan Roots</h2>
                        <p>Birthdays in Scripture—Pharaoh’s (Genesis 40:20-22) with an execution, Herod’s (Mark 6:21-28) with John’s beheading—link to pagan death, not joy, with Greek Artemis candles (Herodotus, 450 BCE) rejected by Christians like Origen (250 CE). Ecclesiastes 7:1 favors death’s day, yet parties mimic false gods.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The day of death is better than the day of birth.” —Ecclesiastes 7:1</p>
                        <h2>Temple Commerce Today</h2>
                        <p>Jesus expelled temple merchants twice—early with a whip (John 2:13-16) and later flipping tables (Matthew 21:12-13)—calling it a “cave of robbers” (Jeremiah 7:11), not prayer, as Roman records (30 CE) note market activity. Modern church yard sales repeat this misuse.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a cave of robbers.” —Matthew 21:13</p>
                        <h2>Fate and Astrology</h2>
                        <p>Fate via astrology claims a fixed destiny, unlike Jehovah’s free will offer—“choose life” (Deuteronomy 30:19), “choose whom you serve” (Joshua 24:15)—with Babylonians (2000 BCE) mapping stars, debunked by science showing no celestial sway. Horoscopes mislead, denying choice.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I have put life and death before you... choose life.” —Deuteronomy 30:19</p>
                        <h2>The Cross Symbol</h2>
                        <p>The cross, a pagan symbol for Tammuz (1500 BCE), not Jesus’ stake (*stauros*, Galatians 3:13), violates Exodus 20:4’s image ban, adopted by Constantine (312 CE) per Eusebius. Early Christians shunned it; today’s jewelry honors falsehood, not Jehovah.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must not make for yourself a carved image.” —Exodus 20:4</p>

                        <h2>Judaism’s Rejection of Jesus</h2>
                        <p>Judaism honors Jehovah but denies Jesus as Messiah, missing Isaiah 53’s suffering servant from the Dead Sea Scrolls (150 BCE), fulfilled in Christ (John 14:6), adding Talmud traditions like Hanukkah (200-500 CE) not in Scripture. Masada’s synagogues (70 CE) show Law devotion, not Jehovah’s full plan.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” —John 14:6</p>
                        <h2>Buddhism’s Godless Quest</h2>
                        <p>Buddhism seeks nirvana, ignoring Jehovah as Creator (Revelation 4:11), with Siddhartha’s 500 BCE teachings unproven—relics like Buddha’s tooth lack evidence, and science (EEGs) refutes reincarnation. It’s a godless path, missing Jehovah’s truth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things.” —Revelation 4:11</p>
                        <h2>Hinduism’s Polytheistic Maze</h2>
                        <p>Hinduism’s many gods—Vishnu, Shiva—clash with Exodus 20:3, its Vedas (1200 BCE) pushing reincarnation against Genesis 3:19’s dust return and Cambrian sudden life (540 million years ago). Angkor Wat (1100 CE) lacks rebirth proof, veiling Jehovah’s light.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must not have any other gods besides me.” —Exodus 20:3</p>
                        <h2>Islam’s Denial of the Ransom</h2>
                        <p>Islam’s Allah omits Jesus’ ransom (John 17:3), denying his death (Quran 4:157), with Muhammad’s 610 CE revelations tied to the pagan Kaaba (Ibn Hisham, 800 CE) and a flat-earth hint (Quran 71:19) lagging Job 26:7. It misses Jehovah’s plan.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</p>
                        <h2>Catholicism’s Human Traditions</h2>
                        <p>Catholicism’s saint prayers and Trinity lack Scrolls (1947) support, defying 1 Timothy 2:5’s one mediator, Jesus, with Constantine’s cross (312 CE) and Trent (1545) adding paganism, unlike early Christians (Justin Martyr, 150 CE). It clouds Jehovah’s worship.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus.” —1 Timothy 2:5</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Satan’s Temporary Dominion</h2>
                        <p>Satan rules now (1 John 5:19), deceiving since Eden (John 8:44), with empires like Babylon and Rome falling (Revelation 11:15) and man’s wars since Sumer (3000 BCE) failing, soon ended by Jehovah’s Kingdom (Daniel 2:44).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” —1 John 5:19</p>
                        <h2>The Trinity Doctrine</h2>
                        <p>Trinity, from Nicaea (325 CE), mimics pagan triads (e.g., Ninurta-Nergal), not Scripture—John 17:3 names Jehovah alone true God, 1 Corinthians 11:3 ranks Him above Christ, rejected by early Christians (Justin Martyr, 150 CE).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The head of the Christ is God.” —1 Corinthians 11:3</p>
                        <h2>Hellfire’s False Fear</h2>
                        <p>Hellfire contradicts Ezekiel 18:4—“the soul who sins will die”—from Greek Hades and Dante (1320), not Bible, with EEGs showing death ends awareness, exposing Satan’s scare tactic against Jehovah’s justice.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The soul who sins is the one who will die.” —Ezekiel 18:4</p>
                        <h2>The Immortal Soul Myth</h2>
                        <p>Immortal soul, from Plato (400 BCE), not Genesis 2:7’s “living soul,” denies Ecclesiastes 9:10’s “no work in the Grave” and Leviticus 19:31’s spiritism ban, with Egyptian tombs (2500 BCE) and decay studies exposing Satan’s lie.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“There is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave.” —Ecclesiastes 9:10</p>
                        <h2>Evolution’s Falsehood</h2>
                        <p>Satan’s lie of evolution claims life morphed from simple to complex, yet Genesis 1:25 declares Jehovah created kinds distinctly—no fossil record shows in-between stages, with the Cambrian Explosion (540 million years ago) revealing sudden, fully formed species, not gradual shifts, while Darwin’s hoped-for transitions (e.g., fish-to-amphibian) remain absent, exposing this theory as a baseless myth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“God went on to make the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds.” —Genesis 1:25</p>
                        <h2>Babylon the Great—False Religion United</h2>
                        <p>Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, misleads mankind away from Jehovah (Revelation 18:2-4). From ancient Babylon’s gods to today’s divided churches, it unites all who reject Bible truth, riding political powers (Revelation 17:3-5) and spreading lies about God’s name, hellfire, and the soul. Jehovah calls His people to flee her before she’s destroyed.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.” —Revelation 18:4</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Biblical Scientific Accuracy</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Word predates science—Leviticus 12:3’s eighth-day circumcision aligns with Vitamin K peaks (1935 discovery), Job 26:7’s earth “upon nothing” precedes gravity, and Ecclesiastes 1:7’s water cycle beats meteorology, proving its divine shine.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.” —Job 26:7</p>
                        <h2>Creation’s Orderly Design</h2>
                        <p>Genesis 1’s days—light, atmosphere, land, sun, sea life, animals—match earth’s stages, with Cambrian Explosion (540 million years ago) showing sudden “kinds,” no evolution fossils (e.g., fish-to-amphibian), refuting Darwin and shining as Jehovah’s truth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” —Genesis 1:1</p>
                        <h2>History Proves Accuracy</h2>
                        <p>The Bible’s history shines true—Daniel 2 predicts Babylon’s fall to Cyrus (539 BCE), named in Isaiah 44:28 150 years prior, while Daniel 8:5-7 foresaw Alexander the Great’s conquest (331 BCE), confirmed by Persian and Greek records like the Cyrus Cylinder and Arrian’s histories, unmatched by any human text.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“He said to me, ‘You are my servant, Israel, through whom I will show my splendor.’” —Isaiah 44:28</p>
                        <h2>Dead Sea Scrolls’ Testimony</h2>
                        <p>Dead Sea Scrolls (1947) affirm Scripture—Isaiah (150 BCE) matches today, 900 manuscripts (250 BCE-70 CE) confirm Daniel 9:24-26’s Jesus prediction, shining eternally (1 Peter 1:25) unlike shifting human works.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The word of Jehovah remains forever.” —1 Peter 1:25</p>
                        <h2>Trustworthy Beyond Doubt</h2>
                        <p>Archaeology cements Bible truth—Jericho’s walls fell outward (Joshua 6:20), verified by digs (Garstang, 1930s), Tyre’s ruin became a “fishing spot” (Ezekiel 26:5) as Alexander’s causeway (332 BCE) proves, and Pilate’s stone (1961 find) confirms John 19:13, leaving no room for skepticism.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘I will make you a devastated place, like the cities that are uninhabited.’” —Ezekiel 26:19</p>
                        <h2>Jehovah’s Name Revealed</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s name, used 7,000+ times (Exodus 3:15, Psalm 83:18), was obscured by “LORD” since 3rd-century CE edits (Codex Sinaiticus), but Jesus declared it (John 17:6), a shining truth distinguishing Jehovah’s worship.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“That men may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” —Psalm 83:18</p>

                        <h2>Jehovah’s Original Purpose</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah planned Paradise Earth (Genesis 1:28), undone by Satan’s lie, not His will—man’s self-rule fails, with wars since Sumer (3000 BCE), but Psalm 37:11 and Jesus’ ransom (John 17:3) restore it.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.” —Psalm 37:11</p>
                        <h2>Satan’s Expulsion from Heaven</h2>
                        <p>In 1914, Jesus cast Satan down to earth, fulfilling Revelation 12:7-9. This triggered the “woe for the earth,” seen in global conflict and unrest. Satan knows his time is short—Jehovah’s Kingdom will soon end his influence forever.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of time.” —Revelation 12:12</p>
                        <h2>Earthly Resurrection Under the Kingdom</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom will resurrect billions to life on earth (John 5:28-29), fulfilling His promise to undo death. Faithful ones from all times will return to a peaceful world, guided by accurate knowledge (Isaiah 26:19), showing Jehovah’s perfect justice and love.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” —John 5:28-29</p>
                        <h2>Paradise Restored</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom ends death (Revelation 21:4), reviving Eden—fossils (300 million years old) hint at its past—where homes and vineyards thrive (Isaiah 65:21-22) and animals live peacefully (Isaiah 11:6-9), surpassing man’s chaos.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They will build houses and live in them, and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.” —Isaiah 65:21</p>
                        <h2>Everlasting Life Ahead</h2>
                        <p>Paradise brings eternal life—Psalm 133:3’s dew-like renewal, health from Leviticus’ laws (science-approved), death gone (1 Corinthians 15:26), and resurrection (John 5:28-29) under Jehovah’s knowledge (Isaiah 11:9), outshining man’s ruin.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The last enemy, death, is to be brought to nothing.” —1 Corinthians 15:26</p>
                        <h2>Choosing Jehovah’s Way</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom crushes man’s rule (Daniel 2:44), spreading His knowledge (Isaiah 11:9)—faith’s peace shines now (studies confirm)—urging choice of truth (Proverbs 23:23) via Jesus (John 14:6) over Satan’s failure.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Buy truth and do not sell it—wisdom and discipline and understanding.” —Proverbs 23:23</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Using Jehovah’s Name</h2>
                        <p>Jesus imitated Jehovah by making His name known, praying “I have made your name manifest” (John 17:6) and teaching its use (Matthew 6:9), echoing its 7,000+ Bible mentions (Psalm 83:18), unlike 3rd-century CE removals (Codex Sinaiticus). We follow by boldly saying “Jehovah” in worship.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me.” —John 17:6</p>
                        <h2>Bible Over Traditions</h2>
                        <p>Jesus prioritized Scripture over traditions, rebuking Pharisees for nullifying God’s Word with rules (Mark 7:13), teaching from the Law and Prophets (Luke 4:16-17), not man-made creeds. We imitate him by studying the Bible daily, rejecting holiday rituals.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You make the word of God invalid by your tradition.” —Mark 7:13</p>
                        <h2>Sharing Truth House-to-House</h2>
                        <p>Jesus shared truth personally, teaching in homes and villages (Luke 8:1), a model his disciples followed house-to-house (Acts 20:20), unlike distant clergy of his day. We follow by knocking on doors, offering Jehovah’s hope directly.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were for your good.” —Acts 20:20</p>
                        <h2>No War or Politics</h2>
                        <p>Jesus avoided war and politics, saying “my Kingdom is no part of this world” (John 18:36) and refusing Satan’s rule (Matthew 4:8-10), unlike zealots of 30 CE. We imitate by staying neutral, loving enemies (Matthew 5:44), not fighting or voting.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“My Kingdom is no part of this world.” —John 18:36</p>
                        <h2>Praying to Jehovah</h2>
                        <p>Jesus prayed directly to Jehovah, teaching “Our Father in the heavens” (Matthew 6:9) and crying out in need (Matthew 27:46), not to saints or idols, a practice from 30 CE Jerusalem. We follow by praying only to Jehovah, trusting Him alone.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.” —Matthew 6:9</p>

                        <h2>The Narrow Path</h2>
                        <p>Jesus taught a narrow path to life, saying “few are finding it” (Matthew 7:13-14), unlike broad, popular religions blending paganism and lies—Jehovah’s Witnesses alone walk this tight road, rejecting worldly ways for Bible truth since 1870s studies by Charles Taze Russell.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are finding it.” —Matthew 7:14</p>
                        <h2>Not All Enter</h2>
                        <p>Jesus warned that not all saying “Lord, Lord” enter the Kingdom, only those doing Jehovah’s will (Matthew 7:21-23)—Jehovah’s Witnesses stand apart, obeying God’s laws over man’s, unlike churches claiming faith yet steeped in 4th-century CE pagan creeds.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father.” —Matthew 7:21</p>
                        <h2>Bible Alone</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses use only the Bible, as 2 Timothy 3:16 declares it sufficient, rejecting added books like the Talmud, Quran, or catechisms—since 1931, their New World Translation restores Jehovah’s name, unlike religions diluting truth with human texts.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight.” —2 Timothy 3:16</p>
                        <h2>Pure Worship</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses offer pure worship, honoring Jehovah alone with spirit and truth (John 4:23-24), free of pagan festivals, idolatrous images, and man-made doctrines—unlike religions tainted by ancient Babylonian rites, they uphold Jehovah’s standards unblemished.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth.” —John 4:23</p>
                        <h2>Making Disciples</h2>
                        <p>Jesus commanded “go, make disciples” (Matthew 28:19-20), teaching all nations Jehovah’s truth—Jehovah’s Witnesses obey, training millions globally since 1919, unlike static churches of Christendom, fulfilling this charge with Bible-based education.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them... teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded.” —Matthew 28:19-20</p>
                        <h2>Witnesses of Truth</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses prove the truth—neutral in war (Isaiah 2:4), preaching globally, unified without clergy (1 Corinthians 1:10), unlike divided, politicized faiths since Rome’s fall (476 CE). Named His witnesses (Isaiah 43:10), their fruits since 1919 show Jehovah’s blessing.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You are my witnesses,” declares Jehovah, “and I am God.” —Isaiah 43:10</p>

                <h3>Catholicism: Idolatry and Human Traditions</h3>
                <p>Catholicism, rooted in 4th-century CE Rome, blends Scripture with paganism, praying to saints and Mary as mediators, defying 1 Timothy 2:5’s sole mediator, Jesus. Statues and icons, adorning basilicas like St. Peter’s since the 6th century, violate Exodus 20:4, mirroring Babylonian idol worship (2000 BCE). The rosary, formalized in 1215 CE, uses repetitive chants like pagan rituals, unlike Jesus’ simple prayer (Matthew 6:7-9). The Trinity, cemented at Nicaea (325 CE), contradicts John 17:3, naming Jehovah alone as God. Papal infallibility, declared in 1870, elevates human authority, nullifying Scripture, as Jesus condemned (Mark 7:13). Catholics celebrate Christmas (Saturnalia, 4th-century CE) and Easter (Eostre rites, 8th-century CE), ignoring 2 Corinthians 6:17’s call to separate. Their vast wealth, with Vatican assets in billions, and political alliances since Constantine’s 313 CE edict contrast Jesus’ humility (Matthew 8:20). Ornate clergy, with mitres and robes, mimic pagan priests, not Christ’s simplicity. Failure to preach house-to-house (Acts 20:20) disobeys Matthew 28:19-20, leaving followers in spiritual darkness. Catholic Crusades (1095-1291 CE) and Inquisition (13th-19th centuries) promoted violence, defying Jesus’ peace (John 16:33). Their focus on tradition over Bible truth keeps millions from Jehovah’s Kingdom.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus.” —1 Timothy 2:5</p>
                <p class="scripture">“You must not make for yourself a carved image.” —Exodus 20:4</p>
                <p class="scripture">“In vain they worship me, teaching commands of men as doctrines.” —Mark 7:13</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Get out from among them, and separate yourselves.” —2 Corinthians 6:17</p>

                <h3>Protestantism: Fragmented Doctrines and Worldly Ways</h3>
                <p>Protestantism, sparked by Luther’s 1517 reformation, encompasses Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Seventh-day Adventists, Anglicans, Lutherans, Quakers, Amish, Evangelicals, Anabaptists, and Reformed Churches, but retains Catholic errors. Most teach the Trinity, despite John 14:28’s clear statement, “the Father is greater than I.” Hellfire, rooted in Plato’s myths (400 BCE), contradicts Ezekiel 18:4’s truth that “the soul who sins will die.” Many engage in politics, wars, or social activism, ignoring Jesus’ neutrality (John 18:36). Pagan holidays—Christmas (Saturnalia) and Easter (8th-century CE Germanic rites)—defy 2 Corinthians 6:17. Over 33,000 denominations since the 16th century lack Jesus’ prayed-for unity (John 17:21). Most fail to preach house-to-house (Acts 20:20), disobeying Matthew 28:19-20. Their “Sola Scriptura” claim is undermined by creeds like the Westminster Confession (1646 CE), defying 2 Timothy 3:16-17’s sufficiency of Scripture. Clerical titles like “Reverend,” rooted in Catholic tradition, violate Matthew 23:8’s equality among brothers. Tithing, formalized in the 8th century CE, lacks New Testament support, clashing with 2 Corinthians 9:7’s voluntary giving.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Baptists</strong>: Baptists, emerging in the 1600s, stress believer’s baptism (Acts 8:36), but their “once saved, always saved” doctrine, from Calvin’s 1530s teachings, ignores James 2:17’s faith with works and Hebrews 10:26’s warning against deliberate sin. Political activism, like voting or supporting military, defies John 18:36. Paid clergy contrast Jesus’ unpaid ministry (Matthew 10:8). Sunday worship, from the 4th-century CE Council of Laodicea, ignores Exodus 20:8-11’s seventh-day command.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Methodists</strong>: Methodists, founded by John Wesley in the 1730s, ordain women clergy, violating 1 Timothy 2:12’s creation-based restriction. Infant baptism, from Anglican roots, contradicts Acts 8:36-38. Social justice, like poverty or climate initiatives, overshadows preaching Jehovah’s Kingdom (Matthew 24:14). Trinity and hellfire oppose John 17:3. Wesleyan perfectionism, claiming sinless perfection, contradicts 1 John 1:8. Ecumenical ties, like the World Methodist Council (1881), defy 2 Corinthians 6:14’s separation from false religion.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Presbyterians</strong>: Presbyterians, following Calvin’s 1530s reforms, teach predestination, denying Deuteronomy 30:19’s free will. Infant baptism, a 3rd-century CE tradition, ignores Acts 8:36-38. Trinity and political ties defy 1 Corinthians 11:3 and John 18:36. Covenant theology justifies infant baptism as a “covenant sign,” lacking Scriptural support (Acts 2:38). Formal Lord’s Supper rituals add unscriptural ceremonies, clashing with 1 Corinthians 11:25’s simplicity.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Pentecostals</strong>: Pentecostals, from the 1900s, emphasize tongues and emotionalism, contradicting 1 Corinthians 14:40’s orderly worship. Prosperity teachings and political activism defy Matthew 6:19-20 and John 18:36. Faith healing and modern miracles, from the 1906 Azusa Street Revival, ignore 1 Corinthians 13:8-10’s cessation of gifts. Love of money through prosperity focus risks ruin (1 Timothy 6:9-10).</p>
                <p>- <strong>Seventh-day Adventists</strong>: Seventh-day Adventists, founded in the 1860s by Ellen White, add White’s writings, defying 2 Timothy 3:16. Investigative judgment contradicts Hebrews 9:27. Limited preaching disobeys Matthew 28:19-20. Sabbath legalism, with dietary laws from White’s visions, adds to Scripture (Colossians 2:16). White’s failed predictions, like Christ’s 1840s return, fail Deuteronomy 18:22’s prophetic test.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Anglicans</strong>: Anglicans, formed in the 1530s, retain Catholic rituals like infant baptism, ignoring Acts 8:36-38. State church ties defy John 18:36. The Book of Common Prayer (1549 CE) includes unscriptural liturgies and prayers to saints, violating 1 Timothy 2:5. Monarchical allegiance, from Henry VIII’s 1534 break, loves the world (1 John 2:15).</p>
                <p>- <strong>Lutherans</strong>: Lutherans, from 1517, uphold infant baptism and consubstantiation, lacking Scriptural basis (Acts 8:36-38). Social programs over preaching ignore Matthew 24:14. Luther’s antisemitism, from writings like *On the Jews and Their Lies* (1543 CE), contradicts Romans 10:12. The Augsburg Confession (1530 CE) adds to Scripture, defying 2 Timothy 3:16.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Quakers</strong>: Quakers, from the 1650s, reject ordinances and clergy, contradicting Matthew 28:19’s baptism command, which Jesus himself fulfilled (Matthew 3:15-16). Pacifism and inner light focus ignore John 17:3. The “inner light” doctrine risks straying from Scripture’s authority (2 Peter 1:19-21).</p>
                <p>- <strong>Amish</strong>: Amish, from the 1690s, enforce man-made rules (e.g., shunning technology), defying Colossians 2:20-23. Isolationism contradicts Matthew 28:19-20. Shunning (*Meidung*), for minor infractions, lacks Scriptural balance (2 Thessalonians 3:14-15). German dialect worship hinders outreach, defying 1 Corinthians 14:9’s clear communication.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Evangelicals</strong>: Evangelicals, growing since the 20th century, focus on emotional altar calls, lacking Scriptural basis for salvation (Acts 2:38). Political activism, like supporting conservative agendas, defies John 18:36. Prosperity gospel teachings, common in megachurches, contradict Matthew 6:24’s warning against serving wealth.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Anabaptists</strong>: Anabaptists, from the 1520s, reject infant baptism, aligning with Acts 8:36-38, but their communal living and pacifism often overshadow preaching (Matthew 28:19-20). Rejection of all oaths, based on a misreading of Matthew 5:34, ignores Jesus’ broader context (Matthew 5:17).</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reformed Churches</strong>: Reformed Churches, rooted in Calvin’s 1530s teachings, uphold predestination, denying Deuteronomy 30:19’s free will. Their amillennialism, rejecting a literal Kingdom, contradicts Revelation 20:4’s thousand-year reign. Clerical hierarchy defies Matthew 23:8.</p>

                <h3>Orthodox Christianity: Ritualistic Idolatry</h3>
                <p>Eastern Orthodoxy, split from Catholicism in 1054 CE, venerates icons, like 6th-century CE mosaics in Hagia Sophia, violating Exodus 20:5’s ban on bowing to images. Their Trinity and immortal soul doctrines, from 4th-century CE councils like Constantinople (381 CE), contradict John 14:28 (“the Father is greater than I”) and Ecclesiastes 9:10 (“no work in the Grave”). Ornate clergy, with gilded vestments and beards, act as intermediaries, ignoring John 14:6’s sole way, Jesus. They rarely preach house-to-house, disobeying Matthew 28:19-20’s command to make disciples globally. Christmas (Saturnalia) and Easter (fertility cults) taint worship, defying John 4:23’s spirit and truth. Mysticism, like 14th-century CE hesychast prayer from Mount Athos, seeks experiences over Jehovah’s Word, echoing pagan spiritualism. Orthodoxy’s ties to national governments, as in Russia’s state church since the 988 CE baptism of Rus, entangle them in worldly conflicts, defying Jesus’ neutrality (John 18:36). Their veneration of relics, like saints’ bones, mirrors 3rd-century CE pagan practices, not Christ’s teachings. Prayers to saints on feast days, like St. Basil’s on January 1, rooted in 4th-century CE traditions, violate 1 Timothy 2:5, as Jesus alone mediates. Infant baptism, practiced since the 3rd century CE, and the sign of the cross lack Scriptural basis, clashing with Acts 8:12’s requirement of belief for baptism. The Eucharist’s literal transformation into Christ’s body and blood, formalized by the 11th century CE, contradicts John 6:54’s symbolic meaning and Leviticus 17:14’s ban on blood consumption. Monasticism, like Mount Athos since the 10th century CE, and asceticism promote withdrawal, yet Matthew 5:16 calls for active good works among people. Placing “Holy Tradition” from councils (325–787 CE) over Scripture defies 2 Timothy 3:16’s sufficiency. By prioritizing ritual over active ministry, Orthodoxy fails to guide followers to Jehovah’s Kingdom.</p>

                <h3>Mormonism: False Scriptures and Polytheism</h3>
                <p>Mormonism, founded by Joseph Smith in the 1820s, adds the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price to the Bible, defying 2 Timothy 3:16’s declaration that Scripture is sufficient. Their belief in three separate gods (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) and that men can become gods of their own worlds contradicts John 17:3, naming Jehovah alone as God, and echoes Satan’s lie (Genesis 3:5). Works-based salvation through secret temple rituals, practiced since the 1830s in Nauvoo, opposes Ephesians 2:8-9’s grace by faith. They celebrate Christmas (Saturnalia, 4th-century CE) and Easter, ignoring 2 Corinthians 6:17’s call to separate. Missionary work, limited to young men for two years, fails Matthew 24:14’s universal preaching command. Polygamy, practiced until 1890, and closed temple ceremonies, unlike Jesus’ open teachings (John 18:20), stray from Bible truth. Baptisms for the dead and focus on genealogy lack Scriptural basis, diverting from Jehovah’s worship (John 4:23). Mormonism’s wealth, with billions in assets, and corporate structure contrast Jesus’ humility (Matthew 8:20), misleading followers from the narrow path. They claim a restored priesthood through Smith in 1829, yet Hebrews 7:24 affirms Jesus’ unchangeable priesthood, needing no restoration. The belief in a premortal existence and eternal progression to godhood, taught in their scriptures, defies Isaiah 43:10, which says no gods exist before or after Jehovah. Elevating Smith as a prophet whose words add to the Bible ignores Deuteronomy 18:20’s warning against false prophets who lead away from Jehovah. The Book of Abraham, part of the Pearl of Great Price, claimed as Abraham’s writings, is proven by Egyptologists to be a 1st-century BCE funerary text, exposing Smith’s deception. Their doctrine of a Heavenly Mother introduces goddess worship, lacking Scriptural support and clashing with Deuteronomy 6:4’s monotheism. Mormonism’s teachings lead followers away from Jehovah’s truth, urging us to choose His pure worship as we climb with faith.</p>

                <h3>Old Apostolic Lutherans: Exclusivism and Rituals</h3>
                <p>Old Apostolic Lutherans, a 19th-century Finnish-American sect, claim exclusive salvation, defying John 14:6, where Jesus is the only way. Infant baptism, practiced since their 1870s founding during Finland’s revivalist movement, contradicts Acts 8:36-38’s requirement of conscious belief. Ritualistic services, with confessions to elders and strict gender roles (e.g., women covering hair, men leading), mirror Catholic traditions, not Jesus’ simple gatherings (Acts 20:7). They teach Trinity and hellfire, opposing 1 Corinthians 11:3 (Jehovah above Christ) and Ezekiel 18:4 (“the soul who sins will die”). Their inward focus, shunning modern practices like television or higher education, fails Matthew 28:19-20’s global preaching command. Rooted in Laestadianism, their isolationism fosters division, not the unity Jesus prayed for (John 17:21). Large families, often 10+ children, are prioritized over ministry, unlike Jesus’ focus on spiritual family (Mark 3:35). Their man-made rules, like dress codes, echo Pharisee traditions, condemned by Jesus (Matthew 23:4). By neglecting Jehovah’s truth and active worship, they leave followers spiritually adrift, far from the narrow path to life (Matthew 7:14).</p>

                <h3>Christian Scientists: Denial of Reality</h3>
                <p>Christian Scientists, founded by Mary Baker Eddy in 1879, teach that illness and sin are illusions, contradicting Jesus’ healing of real diseases (Matthew 8:16) and acknowledgment of sin (John 8:11). Eddy’s *Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures*, added to the Bible, defies 2 Timothy 3:16’s sufficiency. Their denial of Jesus’ ransom and vague, Trinity-like views oppose 1 Timothy 2:5 and John 17:3, naming Jehovah as the only true God. Rejecting medical care, even for serious conditions, ignores Luke 5:31, where Jesus likened himself to a physician. Limited preaching, through reading rooms and lectures, disobeys Matthew 28:19-20’s global disciple-making command. While avoiding pagan holidays aligns with truth, their focus on mental healing, rooted in 19th-century New England idealism, strays from Jehovah’s practical worship (John 4:23). Their church, with declining membership since the 20th century, emphasizes Eddy’s teachings over Scripture, misleading followers into denying physical reality and neglecting Jehovah’s provisions for health and salvation. By prioritizing philosophy over Bible truth, Christian Scientists fail to guide souls to the narrow path (Matthew 7:14).</p>

                <h3>Non-Denominational Churches: Worldly Compromise</h3>
                <p>Non-denominational churches, surging since the 1970s, claim independence but compromise with the world. They teach Trinity and hellfire, ignoring John 17:3’s sole true God, Jehovah, and Ezekiel 18:4’s truth that “the soul who sins will die.” Worship with rock bands, light shows, and casual services, common in megachurches since the 1980s, mimics worldly entertainment, not Acts 20:7’s orderly meetings. Prosperity teachings, like those of Joel Osteen, defy Matthew 6:19-20’s call for heavenly treasures, promoting materialism over spiritual riches. They rarely preach house-to-house, neglecting Matthew 28:19-20’s disciple-making command. Approving politics, war, or immoral lifestyles (e.g., same-sex marriage, accepted in many since the 2000s) violates James 4:4’s separation from the world. Their “feel-good” focus, warned against in 2 Timothy 4:3-4, avoids hard truths for popularity, echoing ancient Israel’s false prophets (Jeremiah 23:16). By blending with culture, non-denominational churches fail to uphold Jehovah’s standards, leaving followers vulnerable to Satan’s lies and far from the narrow path to life (Matthew 7:14).</p>

                <h3>True Worship: Jehovah’s Way</h3>
                <p>True worship honors Jehovah alone, using His name (Psalm 83:18), as Jesus did (John 17:6). Jehovah’s Witnesses, organized since the 1870s, reject false doctrines like Trinity, hellfire, and immortal soul, trusting John 17:3 (Jehovah as sole God) and Ezekiel 18:4 (“the soul who sins will die”). They preach house-to-house (Acts 20:20), fulfilling Matthew 28:19-20’s disciple-making command, unlike Christendom’s inaction. Neutral in politics and war (John 18:36), they shun pagan holidays—Christmas (Saturnalia), Easter (Eostre)—keeping worship pure (2 Corinthians 6:17). Unified globally (1 Corinthians 1:10), they rely solely on the Bible (2 Timothy 3:16), not man-made texts or traditions. Their global preaching, in over 240 lands, and translation of Bible materials into 1,000+ languages demonstrate Jehovah’s blessing (Isaiah 43:10). Unlike divided Christendom, their unity and adherence to truth reflect Jesus’ prayer (John 17:21). By living Jehovah’s standards—avoiding immorality, materialism, and falsehood—they walk the narrow path to everlasting life (Matthew 7:14), inviting you to join them in worshipping the true God.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth.” —John 4:23</p>
                <p class="scripture">“You are my witnesses,” declares Jehovah, “and I am God.” —Isaiah 43:10</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life.” —Matthew 7:14</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Now I urge you, brothers, to be in full agreement.” —1 Corinthians 1:10</p>
