                        <h2>Satan’s Deception in Eden</h2>
                        <p>False worship ignited when Satan, as a serpent, deceived Eve into thinking she could be like God and judge right from wrong independently (Genesis 3:1-6), introducing idolatry by placing self or other gods above Jehovah, who demands sole devotion (Exodus 20:3). This rebellion spread to Cain, whose rejected sacrifice and murder of Abel defied Jehovah’s standards (Genesis 4:3-8). Sumerian tablets from 3000 BCE, listing gods like Enki with blood offerings, show polytheism’s rapid rise after Eden.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must not have any other gods besides me.” —Exodus 20:3</p>
                        <h2>The Golden Calf Incident</h2>
                        <p>Fresh from Egypt’s deliverance, the Israelites forged a golden calf, blending Jehovah’s worship with Egyptian bull god Apis practices, incurring about 3,000 deaths as punishment (Exodus 32:4-6, 28), a mix Deuteronomy 12:31 calls detestable. Hazor’s calf figurines from 1400 BCE confirm this idolatry’s spread. It warns against tainting Jehovah’s worship with human traditions.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Every detestable thing that Jehovah hates, they have done.” —Deuteronomy 12:31</p>
                        <h2>Baal Worship and Sacrifices</h2>
                        <p>Baal worship lured Israel into child sacrifice, an act Jehovah never imagined (Jeremiah 19:5), led by kings like Ahab with altars and poles (1 Kings 16:31-32), bringing ruin and judgment. Carthage urns from 800 BCE, holding diseased infant bones, show no blessing, only horror. This reveals Satan’s grip pulling people from Jehovah’s life-giving way.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They built the high places of Baal... to make their sons and daughters pass through the fire.” —Jeremiah 19:5</p>
                        <h2>Ancestor Worship’s Rise</h2>
                        <p>Ancestor worship defied Jehovah’s truth about death, with Egyptians mummifying pharaohs as gods by 2600 BCE, misreading Enoch (Genesis 5:24; Hebrews 11:13 says he died), and China’s Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE) consulting the dead via oracle bones, despite Ecclesiastes 9:5’s “the dead know nothing.” EEGs confirm consciousness ends at death, exposing this early falsehood.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all.” —Ecclesiastes 9:5</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Today’s False Practices</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Christmas and Paganism</h2>
                        <p>Christmas, pegged to December 25, stems from Saturnalia, a Roman sun god festival with feasts, gifts, and evergreens (Pliny, 77 CE), not Jesus’ birth—Luke 2:8’s shepherds suggest a warmer season—shunned by early Christians like Tertullian (200 CE) as pagan. Jehovah demands separation (2 Corinthians 6:17), yet trees and presents persist, echoing idolatry.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Get out from among them, and separate yourselves... and quit touching the unclean thing.” —2 Corinthians 6:17</p>
                        <h2>Easter’s Fertility Rites</h2>
                        <p>Easter mixes Jesus’ resurrection with Eostre’s fertility rites—eggs and rabbits from Saxon spring festivals (Bede, 725 CE)—unsupported by Scripture’s weekly meetings (Acts 20:7) or symbols, with Germanic rabbit icons from 500 CE predating Christianity. Jehovah rejects man-made worship (Matthew 15:9), yet egg hunts continue.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“In vain they worship me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.” —Matthew 15:9</p>
                        <h2>Halloween and Spiritism</h2>
                        <p>Halloween derives from Samhain, a Celtic dead-honoring festival banned as spiritism (Deuteronomy 18:10-12), with costumes and turnips from 900 CE Ireland, later tied to All Saints’ Day (835 CE). Leviticus 19:31 forbids spirit contact, yet trick-or-treating upholds this pagan rite.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“There should not be found in you anyone who... consults the dead.” —Deuteronomy 18:10-11</p>
                        <h2>Birthdays’ Pagan Roots</h2>
                        <p>Birthdays in Scripture—Pharaoh’s (Genesis 40:20-22) with an execution, Herod’s (Mark 6:21-28) with John’s beheading—link to pagan death, not joy, with Greek Artemis candles (Herodotus, 450 BCE) rejected by Christians like Origen (250 CE). Ecclesiastes 7:1 favors death’s day, yet parties mimic false gods.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The day of death is better than the day of birth.” —Ecclesiastes 7:1</p>
                        <h2>Temple Commerce Today</h2>
                        <p>Jesus expelled temple merchants twice—early with a whip (John 2:13-16) and later flipping tables (Matthew 21:12-13)—calling it a “cave of robbers” (Jeremiah 7:11), not prayer, as Roman records (30 CE) note market activity. Modern church yard sales repeat this misuse.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a cave of robbers.” —Matthew 21:13</p>
                        <h2>Fate and Astrology</h2>
                        <p>Fate via astrology claims a fixed destiny, unlike Jehovah’s free will offer—“choose life” (Deuteronomy 30:19), “choose whom you serve” (Joshua 24:15)—with Babylonians (2000 BCE) mapping stars, debunked by science showing no celestial sway. Horoscopes mislead, denying choice.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I have put life and death before you... choose life.” —Deuteronomy 30:19</p>
                        <h2>The Cross Symbol</h2>
                        <p>The cross, a pagan symbol for Tammuz (1500 BCE), not Jesus’ stake (*stauros*, Galatians 3:13), violates Exodus 20:4’s image ban, adopted by Constantine (312 CE) per Eusebius. Early Christians shunned it; today’s jewelry honors falsehood, not Jehovah.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must not make for yourself a carved image.” —Exodus 20:4</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Satan’s Temporary Dominion</h2>
                        <p>Satan rules now (1 John 5:19), deceiving since Eden (John 8:44), with empires like Babylon and Rome falling (Revelation 11:15) and man’s wars since Sumer (3000 BCE) failing, soon ended by Jehovah’s Kingdom (Daniel 2:44).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” —1 John 5:19</p>
                        <h2>The Trinity Doctrine</h2>
                        <p>Trinity, from Nicaea (325 CE), mimics pagan triads (e.g., Ninurta-Nergal), not Scripture—John 17:3 names Jehovah alone true God, 1 Corinthians 11:3 ranks Him above Christ, rejected by early Christians (Justin Martyr, 150 CE).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The head of the Christ is God.” —1 Corinthians 11:3</p>
                        <h2>Hellfire’s False Fear</h2>
                        <p>Hellfire contradicts Ezekiel 18:4—“the soul who sins will die”—from Greek Hades and Dante (1320), not Bible, with EEGs showing death ends awareness, exposing Satan’s scare tactic against Jehovah’s justice.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The soul who sins is the one who will die.” —Ezekiel 18:4</p>
                        <h2>The Immortal Soul Myth</h2>
                        <p>Immortal soul, from Plato (400 BCE), not Genesis 2:7’s “living soul,” denies Ecclesiastes 9:10’s “no work in the Grave” and Leviticus 19:31’s spiritism ban, with Egyptian tombs (2500 BCE) and decay studies exposing Satan’s lie.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“There is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave.” —Ecclesiastes 9:10</p>
                        <h2>Evolution’s Falsehood</h2>
                        <p>Satan’s lie of evolution claims life morphed from simple to complex, yet Genesis 1:25 declares Jehovah created kinds distinctly—no fossil record shows in-between stages, with the Cambrian Explosion (540 million years ago) revealing sudden, fully formed species, not gradual shifts, while Darwin’s hoped-for transitions (e.g., fish-to-amphibian) remain absent, exposing this theory as a baseless myth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“God went on to make the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds.” —Genesis 1:25</p>
                        <h2>Babylon the Great—False Religion United</h2>
                        <p>Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, misleads mankind away from Jehovah (Revelation 18:2-4). From ancient Babylon’s gods to today’s divided churches, it unites all who reject Bible truth, riding political powers (Revelation 17:3-5) and spreading lies about God’s name, hellfire, and the soul. Jehovah calls His people to flee her before she’s destroyed.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.” —Revelation 18:4</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Biblical Scientific Accuracy</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Word predates science—Leviticus 12:3’s eighth-day circumcision aligns with Vitamin K peaks (1935 discovery), Job 26:7’s earth “upon nothing” precedes gravity, and Ecclesiastes 1:7’s water cycle beats meteorology, proving its divine shine.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.” —Job 26:7</p>
                        <h2>Creation’s Orderly Design</h2>
                        <p>Genesis 1’s days—light, atmosphere, land, sun, sea life, animals—match earth’s stages, with Cambrian Explosion (540 million years ago) showing sudden “kinds,” no evolution fossils (e.g., fish-to-amphibian), refuting Darwin and shining as Jehovah’s truth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” —Genesis 1:1</p>
                        <h2>History Proves Accuracy</h2>
                        <p>The Bible’s history shines true—Daniel 2 predicts Babylon’s fall to Cyrus (539 BCE), named in Isaiah 44:28 150 years prior, while Daniel 8:5-7 foresaw Alexander the Great’s conquest (331 BCE), confirmed by Persian and Greek records like the Cyrus Cylinder and Arrian’s histories, unmatched by any human text.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“He said to me, ‘You are my servant, Israel, through whom I will show my splendor.’” —Isaiah 44:28</p>
                        <h2>Dead Sea Scrolls’ Testimony</h2>
                        <p>Dead Sea Scrolls (1947) affirm Scripture—Isaiah (150 BCE) matches today, 900 manuscripts (250 BCE-70 CE) confirm Daniel 9:24-26’s Jesus prediction, shining eternally (1 Peter 1:25) unlike shifting human works.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The word of Jehovah remains forever.” —1 Peter 1:25</p>
                        <h2>Trustworthy Beyond Doubt</h2>
                        <p>Archaeology cements Bible truth—Jericho’s walls fell outward (Joshua 6:20), verified by digs (Garstang, 1930s), Tyre’s ruin became a “fishing spot” (Ezekiel 26:5) as Alexander’s causeway (332 BCE) proves, and Pilate’s stone (1961 find) confirms John 19:13, leaving no room for skepticism.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘I will make you a devastated place, like the cities that are uninhabited.’” —Ezekiel 26:19</p>
                        <h2>Jehovah’s Name Revealed</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s name, used 7,000+ times (Exodus 3:15, Psalm 83:18), was obscured by “LORD” since 3rd-century CE edits (Codex Sinaiticus), but Jesus declared it (John 17:6), a shining truth distinguishing Jehovah’s worship.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“That men may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” —Psalm 83:18</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Jehovah’s Original Purpose</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah planned Paradise Earth (Genesis 1:28), undone by Satan’s lie, not His will—man’s self-rule fails, with wars since Sumer (3000 BCE), but Psalm 37:11 and Jesus’ ransom (John 17:3) restore it.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.” —Psalm 37:11</p>
                        <h2>Satan’s Expulsion from Heaven</h2>
                        <p>In 1914, Jesus cast Satan down to earth, fulfilling Revelation 12:7-9. This triggered the “woe for the earth,” seen in global conflict and unrest. Satan knows his time is short—Jehovah’s Kingdom will soon end his influence forever.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of time.” —Revelation 12:12</p>
                        <h2>Earthly Resurrection Under the Kingdom</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom will resurrect billions to life on earth (John 5:28-29), fulfilling His promise to undo death. Faithful ones from all times will return to a peaceful world, guided by accurate knowledge (Isaiah 26:19), showing Jehovah’s perfect justice and love.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” —John 5:28-29</p>
                        <h2>Paradise Restored</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom ends death (Revelation 21:4), reviving Eden—fossils (300 million years old) hint at its past—where homes and vineyards thrive (Isaiah 65:21-22) and animals live peacefully (Isaiah 11:6-9), surpassing man’s chaos.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They will build houses and live in them, and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.” —Isaiah 65:21</p>
                        <h2>Everlasting Life Ahead</h2>
                        <p>Paradise brings eternal life—Psalm 133:3’s dew-like renewal, health from Leviticus’ laws (science-approved), death gone (1 Corinthians 15:26), and resurrection (John 5:28-29) under Jehovah’s knowledge (Isaiah 11:9), outshining man’s ruin.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The last enemy, death, is to be brought to nothing.” —1 Corinthians 15:26</p>
                        <h2>Choosing Jehovah’s Way</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom crushes man’s rule (Daniel 2:44), spreading His knowledge (Isaiah 11:9)—faith’s peace shines now (studies confirm)—urging choice of truth (Proverbs 23:23) via Jesus (John 14:6) over Satan’s failure.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Buy truth and do not sell it—wisdom and discipline and understanding.” —Proverbs 23:23</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Using Jehovah’s Name</h2>
                        <p>Jesus imitated Jehovah by making His name known, praying “I have made your name manifest” (John 17:6) and teaching its use (Matthew 6:9), echoing its 7,000+ Bible mentions (Psalm 83:18), unlike 3rd-century CE removals (Codex Sinaiticus). We follow by boldly saying “Jehovah” in worship.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me.” —John 17:6</p>
                        <h2>Bible Over Traditions</h2>
                        <p>Jesus prioritized Scripture over traditions, rebuking Pharisees for nullifying God’s Word with rules (Mark 7:13), teaching from the Law and Prophets (Luke 4:16-17), not man-made creeds. We imitate him by studying the Bible daily, rejecting holiday rituals.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You make the word of God invalid by your tradition.” —Mark 7:13</p>
                        <h2>Sharing Truth House-to-House</h2>
                        <p>Jesus shared truth personally, teaching in homes and villages (Luke 8:1), a model his disciples followed house-to-house (Acts 20:20), unlike distant clergy of his day. We follow by knocking on doors, offering Jehovah’s hope directly.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were for your good.” —Acts 20:20</p>
                        <h2>No War or Politics</h2>
                        <p>Jesus avoided war and politics, saying “my Kingdom is no part of this world” (John 18:36) and refusing Satan’s rule (Matthew 4:8-10), unlike zealots of 30 CE. We imitate by staying neutral, loving enemies (Matthew 5:44), not fighting or voting.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“My Kingdom is no part of this world.” —John 18:36</p>
                        <h2>Praying to Jehovah</h2>
                        <p>Jesus prayed directly to Jehovah, teaching “Our Father in the heavens” (Matthew 6:9) and crying out in need (Matthew 27:46), not to saints or idols, a practice from 30 CE Jerusalem. We follow by praying only to Jehovah, trusting Him alone.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.” —Matthew 6:9</p>

                        <h2>The Narrow Path</h2>
                        <p>Jesus taught a narrow path to life, saying “few are finding it” (Matthew 7:13-14), unlike broad, popular religions blending paganism and lies—Jehovah’s Witnesses alone walk this tight road, rejecting worldly ways for Bible truth since 1870s studies by Charles Taze Russell.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are finding it.” —Matthew 7:14</p>
                        <h2>Not All Enter</h2>
                        <p>Jesus warned that not all saying “Lord, Lord” enter the Kingdom, only those doing Jehovah’s will (Matthew 7:21-23)—Jehovah’s Witnesses stand apart, obeying God’s laws over man’s, unlike churches claiming faith yet steeped in 4th-century CE pagan creeds.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father.” —Matthew 7:21</p>
                        <h2>Bible Alone</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses use only the Bible, as 2 Timothy 3:16 declares it sufficient, rejecting added books like the Talmud, Quran, or catechisms—since 1931, their New World Translation restores Jehovah’s name, unlike religions diluting truth with human texts.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight.” —2 Timothy 3:16</p>
                        <h2>Pure Worship</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses offer pure worship, honoring Jehovah alone with spirit and truth (John 4:23-24), free of pagan festivals, idolatrous images, and man-made doctrines—unlike religions tainted by ancient Babylonian rites, they uphold Jehovah’s standards unblemished.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth.” —John 4:23</p>
                        <h2>Making Disciples</h2>
                        <p>Jesus commanded “go, make disciples” (Matthew 28:19-20), teaching all nations Jehovah’s truth—Jehovah’s Witnesses obey, training millions globally since 1919, unlike static churches of Christendom, fulfilling this charge with Bible-based education.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them... teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded.” —Matthew 28:19-20</p>
                        <h2>Witnesses of Truth</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses prove the truth—neutral in war (Isaiah 2:4), preaching globally, unified without clergy (1 Corinthians 1:10), unlike divided, politicized faiths since Rome’s fall (476 CE). Named His witnesses (Isaiah 43:10), their fruits since 1919 show Jehovah’s blessing.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You are my witnesses,” declares Jehovah, “and I am God.” —Isaiah 43:10</p>

                <h3>True Worship: Jehovah’s Way</h3>
                <p>True worship honors Jehovah alone, using His name (Psalm 83:18), as Jesus did (John 17:6). Jehovah’s Witnesses, organized since the 1870s, reject false doctrines like Trinity, hellfire, and immortal soul, trusting John 17:3 (Jehovah as sole God) and Ezekiel 18:4 (“the soul who sins will die”). They preach house-to-house (Acts 20:20), fulfilling Matthew 28:19-20’s disciple-making command, unlike Christendom’s inaction. Neutral in politics and war (John 18:36), they shun pagan holidays—Christmas (Saturnalia), Easter (Eostre)—keeping worship pure (2 Corinthians 6:17). Unified globally (1 Corinthians 1:10), they rely solely on the Bible (2 Timothy 3:16), not man-made texts or traditions. Their global preaching, in over 240 lands, and translation of Bible materials into 1,000+ languages demonstrate Jehovah’s blessing (Isaiah 43:10). Unlike divided Christendom, their unity and adherence to truth reflect Jesus’ prayer (John 17:21). They observe the Memorial of Christ’s death annually on Nisan 14, as Jesus commanded (Luke 22:19), focusing on his ransom over man-made holidays. Baptism follows personal dedication and Bible study, aligning with Acts 8:36-38’s requirement of belief. Loving discipline keeps the congregation clean while encouraging repentance (1 Corinthians 5:11-13). Bible study, through programs like the Theocratic Ministry School since 1943, and the Christian Life and Ministry follows Acts 17:11’s example of daily Scriptural examination. Living simply, they prioritize ministry over materialism, reflecting 1 Timothy 6:8’s contentment with basics, as seen in their volunteer work at Kingdom Halls and conventions. By living Jehovah’s standards—avoiding immorality, materialism, and falsehood—they walk the narrow path to everlasting life (Matthew 7:14), inviting you to join them in worshipping the true God.</p>
