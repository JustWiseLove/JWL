            <p class="scripture">“Solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” — Hebrews 5:14</p>
            <p class="describe">Discernment is the spiritual skill to distinguish true worship, approved by Jehovah, from false worship promoted by Satan. Through Bible study, prayer, and careful observation, Jehovah’s Witnesses develop this ability to navigate deception and honor Jehovah purely, preparing for everlasting life in His Kingdom.</p>

        <!-- Testing Teachings with Scripture -->

                    <summary class="item-button">Testing Teachings with Scripture</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Discernment begins by comparing every teaching to the Bible, as the Bereans did when they “examined the Scriptures daily” to verify Paul’s message. A teaching must align with Jehovah’s sovereignty and Jesus’ role as the truth. For example, does it uphold Jehovah as the only true God, or does it add human rules? True worship relies on Scripture alone, while false worship introduces traditions or philosophies that contradict God’s Word. To grow in discernment, study the Bible regularly to ensure your beliefs match its clear standards.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They examined the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.” — Acts 17:11</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Recognizing Jehovah’s Name</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>True worship centers on Jehovah’s name, which He declared as His memorial forever. Discernment involves checking if a religion boldly uses “Jehovah” in its teachings and prayers, as Jesus did when teaching his followers. Many religions replace Jehovah’s name with titles like “Lord” or “God,” obscuring His identity. This is a key sign of false worship. To sharpen discernment, notice whether a faith honors Jehovah’s name in its publications, songs, and preaching, reflecting its commitment to true worship.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered.” — Exodus 3:15</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Discernment helps identify pagan influences in worship, which Jehovah commands His people to avoid. Look for rituals, symbols, or festivals not found in the Bible, such as those tied to ancient idol worship. For example, does a religion use images or celebrate holidays with roots outside Scripture? True worship, as practiced by Jehovah’s Witnesses, remains free of such traditions, relying solely on God’s Word. To develop this skill, research the origins of religious practices and compare them to Jehovah’s standards for pure worship.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Get out from among them, and separate yourselves, says Jehovah, and quit touching the unclean thing.” — 2 Corinthians 6:17</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Evaluating Global Unity</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>True worshipers are united worldwide, sharing the same beliefs and practices, as Jehovah desires. Discernment involves evaluating whether a religion demonstrates this unity across nations or is divided by conflicting doctrines. Jehovah’s Witnesses, for example, teach the same Bible truths in every country, reflecting God’s spirit. In contrast, false worship often shows division, with differing beliefs or practices. To grow in discernment, observe a religion’s consistency in its teachings and love among its members.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” — Psalm 133:1</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Regular Bible study sharpens discernment, training worshipers to distinguish right from wrong. By using tools like the New World Translation and Watchtower Library, Jehovah’s Witnesses verify teachings against Scripture, building spiritual maturity. False worship relies on human traditions or vague ideas, but true worshipers study diligently to understand Jehovah’s will. To develop this skill, set aside time daily to read the Bible, reflect on its principles, and discuss its truths with others, ensuring your faith rests on solid truth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” — Hebrews 5:14</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Discernment grows through heartfelt prayer to Jehovah, asking for wisdom to see truth clearly. Jesus set the example by praying for guidance during trials, relying on his Father’s direction. When faced with religious claims, pray to understand whether they align with Jehovah’s purpose. False worship lacks this reliance on God, but true worshipers trust Jehovah to guide them. To strengthen discernment, pray regularly, especially when making spiritual decisions, and trust Jehovah to reveal the right path.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God, for he gives generously to all.” — James 1:5</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Discernment involves examining a religion’s fruits, or results, to see if they reflect Jehovah’s blessing. Jesus taught that true worshipers produce good fruits, such as love, peace, and obedience to God’s commands. For example, Jehovah’s Witnesses show love through their global preaching and neutrality in conflicts. Religions marked by greed, division, or violence reveal false worship. To sharpen this skill, look at a faith’s actions—does it promote Jehovah’s standards or worldly values?</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“By their fruits you will recognize them.” — Matthew 7:16</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Discernment leads to the “narrow” path of true worship, which Jesus said few find. This path involves obeying Jehovah’s commands and rejecting popular but false religions. Check if a faith follows Jesus’ example of loyalty to Jehovah alone, as Jehovah’s Witnesses do by prioritizing Scripture over human traditions. False worship often appeals to the masses but leads to destruction. To develop discernment, choose beliefs that align with the Bible’s truth, even if they require sacrifice, for they lead to everlasting life.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Go in through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading to destruction.” — Matthew 7:13</p>
