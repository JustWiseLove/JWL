                        <h2>(c. 1500–400 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>The Hebrew Scriptures, the oldest writings of Jehovah’s inspired Word, were penned primarily in Hebrew, with some Aramaic sections, between approximately 1500 and 400 BCE. These dates are determined through paleographic analysis of ancient inscriptions, such as the Gezer Calendar (10th century BCE), and radiocarbon dating of materials like the Silver Scrolls from Ketef Hinnom, dated to around 600 BCE. This collection, known as the Tanakh, includes 39 books divided into the Law (Torah), Prophets (Nevi’im), and Writings (Ketuvim). Moses began this sacred work, recording the Law after receiving divine instructions at Mount Sinai, including the Ten Commandments written by Jehovah’s own hand (Exodus 31:18). Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel later added their inspired messages, guided by holy spirit, ensuring Jehovah’s will was faithfully recorded, as affirmed by “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16).</p>
                        <p>Central to these writings is Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” which appears 6,973 times, emphasizing its sanctity, as in “I am Jehovah, that is my name” (Isaiah 42:8). The Torah established laws for worship and morality, the Prophets delivered messages of judgment and hope, and the Writings offered wisdom and praise, such as in the Psalms. These texts, written on parchment or papyrus scrolls, were meticulously copied by scribes called Sopherim, who counted letters to ensure accuracy. Stored in synagogues and the temple, they were read aloud to the congregation, strengthening Israel’s covenant with Jehovah. Archaeological finds like the Silver Scrolls, tiny amulets inscribed with blessings invoking “YHWH,” confirm the name’s prominence in daily worship. These writings, free from uninspired additions, set the standard for divine truth, fulfilling “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8).</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(c. 280–150 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>The Septuagint, or LXX, translated the Hebrew Scriptures into Koine Greek between 280 and 150 BCE, making Jehovah’s Word accessible to Greek-speaking Jews after Alexander the Great’s conquests spread Greek culture. Dating is established through paleographic analysis of early fragments like Papyrus Fouad 266, dated to the 2nd century BCE, and historical records of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who reportedly commissioned the work in Alexandria, Egypt. Tradition holds that 70 (or 72) Jewish scholars completed the translation, ensuring fidelity to the Hebrew originals. Most significantly, early Septuagint copies retained “YHWH” in Hebrew characters, resisting the later substitution of “Kyrios” (Lord), as seen in Papyrus Fouad 266, which includes Deuteronomy passages with the divine name intact, fulfilling “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <p>The Septuagint included the 39 books of the Hebrew Scriptures but also added uninspired texts known as the Apocrypha, such as Tobit and Maccabees, which provide historical context but lack divine inspiration, as they were not part of the Hebrew canon. These additions, often moral or historical in nature, were later accepted by some religious traditions but were not considered scripture by early Jews or faithful Christians. The translation process involved careful comparison with Hebrew scrolls, though some interpretive choices emerged, such as rendering “almah” in Isaiah 7:14 as “parthenos” (virgin), impacting messianic prophecy. Used widely in synagogues, the Septuagint became the Bible of early Christians, quoted in the Christian Scriptures (e.g., Matthew 1:23). Its early retention of “YHWH” underscores its reverence for Jehovah’s name, fulfilling “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Early Codices: Jehovah’s Name Fades Amid Uninspired Additions</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(c. 325–350 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Early Codices, such as Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, were compiled between 325 and 350 CE, as confirmed by paleographic analysis of their uncial Greek script and radiocarbon dating of their vellum pages. These codices, transitioning from scrolls to bound books, were among the first complete Christian Bibles, containing the Septuagint (Old Testament) and the Christian Scriptures. Codex Sinaiticus, discovered at Saint Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai and now housed in the British Library, occasionally preserves “YHWH” in Hebrew script within Old Testament quotes, showing awareness of the name’s original presence. However, Codex Vaticanus, stored in the Vatican Library, more consistently uses “Kyrios” (Lord), reflecting a growing trend among scribes to avoid pronouncing the divine name due to Jewish traditions, a shift that obscured “I am Jehovah, that is my name” (Isaiah 42:8).</p>
                        <p>These codices, produced during a time of doctrinal disputes and Roman persecution, also included uninspired additions. Codex Sinaiticus contains the Apocrypha, inherited from the Septuagint, and marginal notes by copyists, such as textual variants or commentary, which were not part of the inspired text. For example, Sinaiticus omits the longer ending of Mark (16:9-20), later added in other manuscripts, indicating early textual tampering. Vaticanus similarly lacks this passage and some pastoral epistles, reflecting variations in early transmission. Despite these issues, the codices preserved the core of Jehovah’s Word, serving as key manuscripts for later translations. Their creation by Christian scribes under pressure from apostasy highlights the challenge of maintaining purity, yet their endurance fulfills “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(c. 382–405 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Latin Vulgate, translated by Jerome between 382 and 405 CE, became the standard Bible of the Western Church, but it further distanced readers from Jehovah’s name. Historical records, including Jerome’s letters, and paleographic analysis of early Vulgate manuscripts, such as the Codex Amiatinus (dated to the early 8th century), confirm this timeline. Commissioned by Pope Damasus I, Jerome worked in Bethlehem, using Hebrew manuscripts for the Old Testament and Greek texts for the Christian Scriptures, revising earlier Old Latin translations. However, following the trend of the time, he replaced “YHWH” with “Dominus” (Lord) throughout, influenced by Jewish and Christian traditions avoiding the divine name, a significant departure from “You, whose name is Jehovah” (Psalm 83:18).</p>
                        <p>The Vulgate included the 39 Hebrew Scripture books, the 27 Christian Scripture books, and the Deuterocanonical books (e.g., Tobit, Maccabees), inherited from the Septuagint but not inspired, as they were absent from the Hebrew canon. These uninspired texts were used for moral instruction but were not scripture. Jerome’s goal was to standardize scripture for the church’s liturgy, producing a unified Latin text for a multilingual empire. The Vulgate’s influence endured for centuries, shaping medieval theology and later translations like the King James Version. However, its removal of Jehovah’s name and inclusion of uninspired texts marked a step away from the original writings, though its preservation of the core message aligns with “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105).</p>

                        <h2>(Discovered 1947–1956, Written c. 200 BCE–70 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered between 1947 and 1956 in the Qumran caves near the Dead Sea, provided undeniable proof that the oldest writings prominently used Jehovah’s name, as “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). These 900+ manuscripts, written between 200 BCE and 70 CE—dated through carbon-14 analysis and paleographic study of their Hebrew script—include nearly every book of the Hebrew Scriptures. The Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa^a), one of the most complete, uses “YHWH” in paleo-Hebrew script to highlight its sanctity, as seen in Isaiah 42:8: “I am Jehovah, that is my name.” Written on parchment and papyrus, the scrolls were likely hidden by the Essenes, a Jewish sect, during the First Jewish-Roman War to protect them from Roman destruction.</p>
                        <p>The scrolls, now housed in the Israel Museum’s Shrine of the Book and the Jordan Museum, reveal a community devoted to scriptural purity. They include biblical texts, sectarian writings (e.g., the Community Rule), and commentaries (e.g., Pesher Habakkuk), showing how the Essenes interpreted prophecy in anticipation of the end times. Unlike later manuscripts, these scrolls contain no uninspired Apocryphal texts or marginal notes, preserving the original Hebrew Scriptures’ integrity. Their text aligns closely with the Masoretic Text (e.g., Leningrad Codex, 1008 CE), with only minor variations, proving scribal accuracy over centuries. This discovery confirmed that Jehovah’s name was central to the oldest writings, countering later translations that omitted it, and set the stage for the New World Translation’s return to these pure sources, fulfilling “My words will not pass away” (Matthew 24:35).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Early Modern Translations: Reliance on Later Writings</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(1382–1885 CE)</h2>
                        <p>Early modern translations, from the Wycliffe Bible to the Revised Version, played a crucial role in making Jehovah’s Word accessible to the masses, breaking the Catholic Church’s monopoly on scripture and fostering spiritual awakening during the Reformation. However, their reliance on later manuscripts, omission of Jehovah’s name, and inclusion of uninspired texts introduced significant flaws, necessitating a translation like the New World Translation to restore the purity of the original writings.</p>
                        <h3>Wycliffe Bible (1382):</h3>
                        <p>The Wycliffe Bible, the first complete English Bible, translated by John Wycliffe, was a landmark in making scripture available in the vernacular, challenging the church’s Latin-only tradition. Handwritten copies were banned due to their reformist impact, marking an early step toward liberating God’s Word. However, it relied solely on the Latin Vulgate, which replaced “YHWH” with “Dominus” (Lord), obscuring “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). This dependence on a secondary source introduced errors, as the Vulgate itself contained uninspired Deuterocanonical books and lacked the precision of the Hebrew originals, hindering the clarity of Jehovah’s truth.</p>
                        <h3>Tyndale Bible (1526):</h3>
                        <p>William Tyndale’s Bible, the first printed English Bible, advanced accessibility by using some Hebrew and Greek texts alongside the Vulgate. Tyndale’s pioneering use of “Jehovah” in passages like Exodus 6:3 was a significant step toward restoring the divine name. Yet, his reliance on the Textus Receptus, a later Greek compilation, included uninspired additions, such as the longer ending of Mark (16:9-20). Tyndale’s execution in 1536 limited his work’s scope, and his translation’s incomplete nature and outdated language restricted its accuracy, falling short of “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <h3>Geneva Bible (1560):</h3>
                        <p>The Geneva Bible, popular among Puritans, furthered the Reformation by providing an affordable, annotated Bible. Its study notes aided personal study, but these notes reflected Calvinist biases, introducing doctrinal errors. Like Tyndale, it relied on the Textus Receptus and used “LORD” instead of “Jehovah,” perpetuating the omission of the divine name. The inclusion of uninspired texts and interpretive commentary strayed from the original manuscripts, diminishing its fidelity to “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <h3>King James Version (1611):</h3>
                        <p>The King James Version, commissioned by King James I, became a literary masterpiece, standardizing English scripture for centuries. It drew from the Textus Receptus and Vulgate, using “Jehovah” in only four places (e.g., Psalm 83:18) while favoring “LORD” elsewhere. Spurious passages, like 1 John 5:7 (the Johannine Comma), absent in early codices like Sinaiticus, were included, reflecting reliance on corrupted manuscripts. Its archaic language, such as “thee” and “thou,” confused later readers, and its failure to incorporate older manuscripts limited its accuracy, obstructing “Your word is a lamp” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <h3>Revised Version (1885):</h3>
                        <p>The Revised Version aimed to update the KJV by incorporating newer manuscripts, such as Westcott and Hort’s Greek text, improving textual accuracy. It retained “LORD” and inconsistent renderings, however, and failed to restore “YHWH” consistently. Its reliance on later sources and retention of uninspired texts perpetuated errors, underscoring the need for a translation grounded in the oldest writings.</p>
                        <p>These translations, while instrumental in spreading God’s Word, introduced errors through their dependence on secondary sources like the Vulgate or Textus Receptus, omission of Jehovah’s name, inclusion of uninspired passages, outdated language, and theological biases. These flaws hindered the clear transmission of Jehovah’s truth, necessitating the New World Translation to return to the oldest, most reliable manuscripts for an accurate and unbiased representation of the inspired Word.</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(1901–Present)</h2>
                        <p>Modern translations, from the American Standard Version to the English Standard Version, improved readability and incorporated newer manuscript discoveries, making Jehovah’s Word more accessible in contemporary language. However, their inconsistent handling of Jehovah’s name, retention of uninspired texts, liberal or paraphrased renderings, and reliance on later manuscripts perpetuated errors, highlighting the need for the New World Translation to provide a faithful, unbiased representation of the oldest texts.</p>
                        <h3>American Standard Version (1901):</h3>
                        <p>The American Standard Version was a significant step forward, restoring “Jehovah” in the Old Testament over 6,000 times, a bold move to honor “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). Its literal approach aided serious study. However, it used “Lord” in New Testament quotations of the Old Testament, creating inconsistency, and relied on later manuscripts that retained uninspired additions, such as Mark 16:9-20, absent in Codex Sinaiticus. This diluted its accuracy and failed to fully restore the divine name’s prominence across both Testaments.</p>
                        <h3>Revised Standard Version (1952):</h3>
                        <p>The Revised Standard Version aimed for ecumenical appeal, using newer manuscripts like the Nestle-Aland Greek text. It rarely used “Jehovah,” favoring “LORD,” and its liberal renderings, such as translating “almah” in Isaiah 7:14 as “young woman” instead of “virgin,” weakened messianic prophecies critical to “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Its inclusion of questionable texts, like John 7:53–8:11, and reliance on later sources compromised its fidelity to the oldest writings.</p>
                        <h3>New American Standard Bible (NASB, 1971):</h3>
                        <p>The New American Standard Bible prioritized literal accuracy, benefiting scholars and students. Yet, it used “LORD” throughout, omitting “YHWH,” and included uninspired passages, such as John 7:53–8:11, unsupported by early manuscripts like Papyrus P66. Its complex sentence structure also hindered accessibility for some readers, falling short of “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <h3>New International Version (NIV, 1978):</h3>
                        <p>The New International Version, with over 450 million copies distributed, achieved widespread popularity through its readable, dynamic-equivalence approach. However, it omitted “Jehovah” entirely, using “LORD,” and relied on paraphrasing, which sacrificed precision in passages like Romans 10:13. It retained additions like Mark 16:9-20, not found in the oldest manuscripts, straying from the purity of “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <h3>New King James Version (NKJV, 1982):</h3>
                        <p>The New King James Version modernized the KJV’s language while preserving its style, appealing to traditionalists. It retained the KJV’s errors, including “LORD” instead of “Jehovah” and spurious texts like 1 John 5:7, ignoring older manuscripts such as Codex Vaticanus. Its adherence to the Textus Receptus limited its textual accuracy, failing to fully honor “You, whose name is Jehovah” (Psalm 83:18).</p>
                        <h3>English Standard Version (ESV, 2001):</h3>
                        <p>The English Standard Version offered a literal yet readable text, drawing on the latest manuscript evidence. It used “LORD” consistently, omitting “YHWH,” and included questionable passages, such as the longer ending of Mark, not supported by early codices. Its evangelical bias in some renderings, like softening terms in passages about judgment, subtly altered meaning, hindering the clarity of “Your word is a lamp” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <p>These modern translations, despite their advances in readability and scholarship, perpetuated critical errors: omitting or inconsistently using Jehovah’s name, including uninspired texts, relying on later manuscripts, and introducing liberal or biased renderings. These flaws obscured the original writings’ purity, necessitating the New World Translation to restore the divine name, exclude uninspired additions, and faithfully reflect the oldest Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts for an accurate and unbiased representation of Jehovah’s Word.</p>

                        <h2>(1950–2013 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The New World Translation (NWT), released in stages from 1950 to 1961 and revised in 2013, was created to address the cumulative errors of prior translations, which omitted Jehovah’s name, included uninspired texts, and relied on later manuscripts. By returning to the oldest Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts, the NWT provides an unbiased and accurate representation of Jehovah’s inspired Word, fulfilling “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Its restoration of the divine name, exclusion of spurious passages, and use of clear, modern language have made it a vital tool for spreading Jehovah’s truth globally, with over 240 million copies in more than 200 languages.</p>
                        <h3>Restoration of Jehovah’s Name:</h3>
                        <p>The NWT restores “Jehovah” 7,237 times, including 6,973 instances in the Hebrew Scriptures and 264 in the Christian Scriptures where Old Testament quotations (e.g., Matthew 4:4 citing Deuteronomy 8:3) or context (e.g., Acts 2:21 citing Joel 2:32) indicate “YHWH” was originally used. Early Septuagint fragments, such as Papyrus Fouad 266, and Hebrew Gospel manuscripts, like Shem-Tob’s Matthew, confirm “YHWH”’s presence in 1st-century texts, but later scribes substituted “Kyrios” (Lord) due to traditions avoiding the divine name. The NWT corrects this error, ensuring consistency with “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6). Unlike translations that used “LORD” or inconsistently applied “Jehovah,” the NWT upholds the sanctity of God’s name across both Testaments, aligning with archaeological evidence like the Moabite Stone (840 BCE), which affirms “YHWH”’s prominence in ancient worship.</p>
                        <h3>Exclusion of Uninspired Texts:</h3>
                        <p>The NWT excludes uninspired texts absent in the oldest manuscripts, such as Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, and Papyrus P46. Passages like 1 John 5:7 (the Johannine Comma), Mark 16:9-20, and John 7:53–8:11, which were likely marginal notes or glosses added by copyists, are omitted, preserving the inspired text’s integrity. Earlier translations, even modern ones, often retained these additions due to tradition or incomplete manuscript evidence, diluting “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16). The NWT’s rigorous textual analysis ensures only divinely inspired content is included, addressing the flaws of its predecessors.</p>
                        <h3>Reliance on the Oldest Writings:</h3>
                        <p>Inspired by discoveries like the Dead Sea Scrolls, which confirmed “YHWH”’s prominence in texts like the Great Isaiah Scroll, the NWT relies on the oldest available manuscripts: the Aleppo and Leningrad Codices for the Hebrew Scriptures and early Greek manuscripts, such as Papyrus P66 and P75, for the Christian Scriptures. Unlike early modern translations that depended on the corrupted Textus Receptus or the Latin Vulgate, or modern translations using later compilations like the Nestle-Aland text with lingering errors, the NWT prioritizes the most reliable sources. This commitment to textual purity counters the errors of translations swayed by ecclesiastical traditions or incomplete scholarship.</p>
                        <h3>Clear, Modern Language:</h3>
                        <p>The NWT’s clear, modern language enhances accessibility, avoiding the archaic terms of the King James Version or the complex syntax of the New American Standard Bible. Precise renderings, such as “soul” instead of “spirit” in Genesis 2:7, reflect Hebrew and Greek terms accurately, clarifying doctrines obscured by prior translations’ vague or biased wording. Unlike the New International Version’s paraphrasing or the Revised Standard Version’s liberal interpretations, the NWT maintains fidelity to the original texts, ensuring “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <h3>Scholarly Rigor:</h3>
                        <p>The NWT’s translation process involved a committee of dedicated scholars who cross-referenced thousands of manuscripts, including the Masoretic Text, Septuagint fragments, and early codices, to avoid doctrinal bias. Unlike translations influenced by Trinitarian or denominational agendas, such as the English Standard Version’s evangelical leanings or the Geneva Bible’s Calvinist notes, the NWT prioritizes scriptural accuracy over tradition. Its revisions, particularly in 2013, incorporated advancements in textual criticism and archaeology, refining renderings to align with the oldest writings, fulfilling “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p>The NWT’s global impact underscores its necessity. Translated into over 200 languages and distributed in 240 million copies, it equips Jehovah’s Witnesses to preach in 240 lands, overcoming barriers like Russia’s 2017 ban. Unlike popular translations like the NIV, which sacrifice accuracy for readability, or the ASV, which faltered in consistency, the NWT combines scholarly rigor with practical clarity. Its restoration of Jehovah’s name, exclusion of uninspired texts, and reliance on the oldest manuscripts address the flaws of centuries of translations, making it the definitive tool for those seeking the truth of God’s Word, as “You are my witnesses,” says Jehovah (Isaiah 43:10).</p>
