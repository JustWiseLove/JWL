                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Youths who serve Jehovah shine as “lights in the world” (Philippians 2:15), choosing faithfulness over worldly desires, “Flee from youthful desires” (2 Timothy 2:22). Timothy, a young disciple in 50 CE, was commended, “Let no one look down on your youth” (1 Timothy 4:12), for his zeal. Satan tempts with immorality, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah strengthens, “I am with you” (Isaiah 41:10). Youths stand firm, “Be wise, my son” (Proverbs 27:11), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), preparing for “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Daniel, who “refused to defile himself” (Daniel 1:8) in 617 BCE, faithful youths resist compromise, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They study, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), and rely on Jehovah, “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). Their example inspires, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), as they align with Jehovah’s purpose, “A new earth” where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Choosing Faith</h2>
                        <p>Youths choose Jehovah over peer pressure, “Do not follow after the crowd” (Exodus 23:2), and immorality, “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Corinthians 6:18). Joseph’s stand, “How could I commit this great evil?” (Genesis 39:9), around 1711 BCE, guides them. They pray, “Create in me a clean heart” (Psalm 51:10), ensuring “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Shining as Examples</h2>
                        <p>Youths shine by preaching, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), and living purely, “Be an example in conduct” (1 Timothy 4:12). They follow Jesus’ youth, “He grew in wisdom” (Luke 2:52), and trust, “Jehovah is my helper” (Hebrews 13:6), preparing for “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let no one look down on your youth.” —1 Timothy 4:12</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Resisting Peer Pressure</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Peer pressure tempts youths to conform, “Do not be conformed to this system of things” (Romans 12:2), but Jehovah’s standards protect, “Guard your heart” (Proverbs 4:23). In 607 BCE, Daniel’s companions resisted idolatry, “We will not serve your gods” (Daniel 3:18), showing courage. Satan pushes compromise, “The god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah empowers, “I will make you firm” (Isaiah 41:10). Youths resist, “Be wise, my son” (Proverbs 27:11), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Esther, who stood firm in 475 BCE, “If I perish, I perish” (Esther 4:16), youths reject worldly ways, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They seek godly friends, “He who walks with wise people will become wise” (Proverbs 13:20), and pray, “Do not bring us into temptation” (Matthew 6:13). Their stand ensures “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Identifying Pressures</h2>
                        <p>Pressures include immorality, “The works of the flesh are evident” (Galatians 5:19), and rebellion, “Do not follow after the crowd” (Exodus 23:2). Youths recognize Satan’s tactics, “He deceives those dwelling on the earth” (Revelation 13:14), and study, “This book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), ensuring “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Building Courage</h2>
                        <p>Youths build courage through prayer, “Give your servant courage” (Psalm 86:16), and association, “Encourage one another” (Hebrews 10:25). Jesus’ resolve, “I have conquered the world” (John 16:33), inspires them. Their strength prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not be conformed to this system of things.” —Romans 12:2</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Youths pursue spiritual goals, “Seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33), over worldly ambitions, “The love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things” (1 Timothy 6:10). Timothy, in 50 CE, served zealously, “From infancy you have known the holy writings” (2 Timothy 3:15). Satan distracts with materialism, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah guides, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105). Youths preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and study, “Pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Samuel, who served from childhood, “Samuel kept growing with Jehovah” (1 Samuel 2:21), around 1100 BCE, youths prioritize worship, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They set goals like preaching or baptism, “Be doers of the word” (James 1:22), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Setting Godly Goals</h2>

David’s aim, “I will praise Jehovah at all times” (Psalm 34:1), inspires youths. They plan, “The plans of the diligent lead to success” (Proverbs 21:5), ensuring “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Achieving Spiritual Success</h2>
                        <p>Youths achieve success through effort, “Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might” (Ecclesiastes 9:10), and prayer, “Do not stop praying” (1 Thessalonians 5:17). Jesus’ focus, “I must do the works of him who sent me” (John 9:4), guides them. Their goals prepare for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Seek first the Kingdom.” —Matthew 6:33</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Maintaining Moral Purity</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Moral purity protects youths, “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Corinthians 6:18), in a world of corruption, “The works of the flesh are evident” (Galatians 5:19). Joseph, in 1711 BCE, resisted temptation, “How could I commit this great evil?” (Genesis 39:9), showing integrity. Satan promotes immorality, “The god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah purifies, “Create in me a clean heart” (Psalm 51:10). Youths guard their minds, “Whatever is true, whatever is righteous” (Philippians 4:8), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Dinah’s caution, “She went out to see” (Genesis 34:1), around 1728 BCE, youths avoid bad influences, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They choose pure entertainment, “Abhor what is wicked” (Romans 12:9), and pray, “Do not bring us into temptation” (Matthew 6:13), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Avoiding Immoral Traps</h2>
                        <p>Traps include pornography, “Everyone who keeps on looking has committed adultery” (Matthew 5:28), and impure media, “Out of the heart come wicked reasonings” (Matthew 15:19).

                        <p>Godly friends strengthen youths, “He who walks with wise people will become wise” (Proverbs 13:20), unlike worldly companions, “Do not be misled: Bad company corrupts good morals” (1 Corinthians 15:33). Jonathan’s loyalty to David, around 1020 BCE, “Jonathan made a covenant with David” (1 Samuel 18:3), shows true friendship. Satan promotes harmful associations, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah guides, “I am with you” (Isaiah 41:10). Youths choose wisely, “Love one another” (John 13:34), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Ruth’s bond with Naomi, “Your people will be my people” (Ruth 1:16), around 1100 BCE, youths seek faithful friends, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4).

                        <p>Youths balance education with worship, “Seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33), avoiding worldly ambitions, “The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God” (1 Corinthians 3:19). Solomon, in 970 BCE, sought divine wisdom, “Give your servant an obedient heart” (1 Kings 3:9), prioritizing Jehovah. Satan pushes secular goals, “The god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah guides, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105). Youths study diligently, “Pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Timothy, taught “from infancy” (2 Timothy 3:15), around 50 CE, youths prioritize spiritual education, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4).

                        <p>Serving Jehovah brings youths joy, “Serve Jehovah with rejoicing” (Psalm 100:2), unlike worldly pursuits, “All of it was vanity” (Ecclesiastes 2:11). In 50 CE, Timothy’s service, “You became imitators of us” (1 Thessalonians 1:6), radiated happiness. Satan offers fleeting pleasures, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah rewards, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Youths preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and worship, “Not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
