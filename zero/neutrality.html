                        <h2>(c. 1513 BCE–5th Century BCE)</h2>
                        <p>The principle of neutrality was evident in the Hebrew Scriptures, where God’s servants prioritized His sovereignty over worldly alliances. Around 1513 BCE, when Israel received the Law, God commanded, “You must not form any marriage alliance with them” (Deuteronomy 7:3), prohibiting political or military ties with pagan nations. Prophets like Daniel, in the 6th century BCE, exemplified this by refusing to bow to King Darius’ image (Daniel 6:10), choosing loyalty to God over Babylonian politics.</p>
                        <p>Unlike surrounding nations, such as Assyria, which formed military coalitions (e.g., the Assyrian Chronicles, circa 700 BCE), Israel was to rely on God, as seen in Isaiah 31:1: “Woe to those going down to Egypt for assistance.” The Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE) preserve these teachings, showing God’s expectation of neutrality, fulfilling “You must not walk in the statutes of the nations” (Leviticus 20:23).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must not walk in the statutes of the nations.” — Leviticus 20:23</p>

                        <h2>(c. 29–33 CE)</h2>
                        <p>Jesus set the ultimate example of neutrality during His ministry from 29 to 33 CE, refusing to engage in worldly politics or conflicts. In John 18:36, when arrested, He declared, “My Kingdom is no part of this world. If my Kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought.” Jesus also avoided political disputes, as seen in Luke 20:25 when He said, “Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God,” sidestepping a trap about Roman taxes.</p>
                        <p>Unlike the Zealots, who sought to overthrow Roman rule through violence, Jesus focused on preaching God’s Kingdom (Matthew 4:17), even healing a Roman centurion’s servant (Matthew 8:5-13) without taking sides. Early manuscripts like Codex Sinaiticus (paleography dated 325–350 CE) preserve these accounts, affirming Jesus’ neutrality, fulfilling “I am no part of the world” (John 17:16).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I am no part of the world.” — John 17:16</p>

                        <h2>(c. 33–100 CE)</h2>
                        <p>Early Christians, from 33 to 100 CE, followed Jesus’ example by remaining neutral in political and military affairs. Acts 5:29 records Peter and the apostles saying, “We must obey God as ruler rather than men,” when ordered to stop preaching. Christians refused to join Roman military campaigns, as noted by historian Tertullian (circa 200 CE), who wrote that Christians “do not go forth as soldiers.” They also avoided emperor worship, often facing persecution, as seen in Revelation 2:10: “Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer.”</p>
                        <p>Unlike Roman citizens who participated in political festivals (e.g., Saturnalia), Christians focused on God’s Kingdom, as Paul wrote in Philippians 3:20: “Our citizenship exists in the heavens.” Early manuscripts like Papyrus P46 (circa 200 CE) preserve these teachings, showing neutrality as a Christian hallmark, fulfilling “We must obey God as ruler rather than men” (Acts 5:29).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” — Acts 5:29</p>

                        <h2>(c. 1st Century CE–Present)</h2>
                        <p>The Bible instructs Christians to remain neutral in political affairs, including abstaining from voting or seeking governmental roles, as Jesus taught in John 17:16: “They are no part of the world.” Paul reinforced this in 2 Timothy 2:4, comparing Christians to soldiers who “do not get involved in the commercial affairs of life,” meaning worldly politics. Early Christians, as noted by historian Eusebius (circa 300 CE), avoided Roman political offices, focusing on God’s Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Unlike many religious groups that endorse candidates or participate in elections, true Christians prioritize allegiance to God’s Kingdom over human governments. For example, during the Roman Empire, Christians did not engage in political campaigns, focusing instead on preaching (Acts 1:8). This neutrality ensures Christians remain “ambassadors substituting for Christ” (2 Corinthians 5:20), free from political bias.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“We are ambassadors substituting for Christ.” — 2 Corinthians 5:20</p>

                        <h2>(c. 1st Century CE–Present)</h2>
                        <p>Neutrality extends to refusing participation in war, as Jesus commanded in Matthew 26:52: “All those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.” Early Christians, as recorded by historian Justin Martyr (circa 150 CE), “refused to make war upon their enemies,” choosing peace over violence. Isaiah 2:4’s prophecy, “They will beat their swords into plowshares,” reflects God’s will for His people to avoid bloodshed, a principle preserved in the Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE).</p>
                        <p>Unlike nations that waged religious wars, such as the Crusades (1095–1291), true Christians have historically avoided military conflict, even under pressure. For example, during the Roman Empire, Christians faced execution for refusing to serve in the army, prioritizing God’s law of peace, fulfilling “Love your enemies” (Matthew 5:44).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Love your enemies.” — Matthew 5:44</p>

                        <h2>(c. 1st Century CE–Present)</h2>
                        <p>Neutrality also means avoiding partisan stances on social issues, as Christians focus on God’s standards. James 4:4 warns, “Friendship with the world is enmity with God,” urging Christians to avoid divisive movements. Early Christians did not join Roman social reforms, as noted by historian Origen (circa 250 CE), who said Christians “do not take part in public affairs.” Instead, they preached God’s Kingdom as the solution (Acts 1:8).</p>
                        <p>In modern times, true Christians remain neutral in debates like civil rights protests or economic policies, focusing on Bible-based solutions. For instance, during the 20th century, Christians avoided taking sides in labor movements, promoting unity through God’s Word instead. This approach ensures Christians remain “the light of the world” (Matthew 5:14), offering hope beyond human solutions.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You are the light of the world.” — Matthew 5:14</p>

                        <h2>(c. 1st Century CE–Present)</h2>
                        <p>Neutrality fosters unity and peace among God’s people, as seen throughout history. By not taking sides in wars or politics, early Christians maintained unity across diverse regions, as foretold in Micah 4:3: “They will not lift up sword, nation against nation.” For example, during the Roman Empire, Christians from different backgrounds worshiped together, focusing on God’s Kingdom (Acts 2:44).</p>
                        <p>Unlike divided religious groups, such as during the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865) where churches split over slavery, neutrality ensures Christians remain united. In modern conflicts, such as the Balkan Wars (1990s), true Christians avoided ethnic divisions, focusing on spiritual brotherhood. This unity, rooted in God’s standards, fulfills “Maintain your conduct fine among the nations” (1 Peter 2:12).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Maintain your conduct fine among the nations.” — 1 Peter 2:12</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(Future Fulfillment)</h2>
                        <p>In God’s Kingdom, neutrality will be fully realized as all human divisions—political, military, and social—disappear. Daniel 2:44 prophesies, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed,” crushing all human governments. Revelation 21:4 promises a future where “death will be no more,” with no need for worldly allegiance, as “the Lord will be King over all the earth” (Zechariah 14:9).</p>
                        <p>Unlike today’s world, where conflicts like the Ukraine-Russia war (2022–present) divide nations, God’s Kingdom will unite all under divine rule, fulfilling the prayer “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10). Christians’ neutrality now prepares them for this future, ensuring they “inherit the Kingdom prepared for you” (Matthew 25:34).</p>
