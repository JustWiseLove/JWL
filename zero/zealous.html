                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Zealous door-to-door ministry fulfills Jehovah’s command, “This good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14), as Jesus instructed, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). In 31 CE, Jesus sent disciples “two by two” to homes, “Preach, saying, ‘The Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near’” (Luke 10:1,7). Satan opposes, “The god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah empowers, “My word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11). Ministers preach house to house, “Be ready in season and out of season” (2 Timothy 4:2), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Paul, who taught “publicly and from house to house” (Acts 20:20) in 50 CE, zealous ministers visit homes, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They prepare, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), and persist, “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Preparing for House-to-House</h2>
                        <p>Preparation involves studying, “This book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), and practicing, “Speak truth each one with his neighbor” (Ephesians 4:25). Jesus’ example, “He went teaching from city to city” (Luke 8:1), inspires. Ministers plan, “The plans of the diligent lead to success” (Proverbs 21:5), ensuring “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Engaging Householders</h2>
                        <p>Ministers engage with kindness, “Clothe yourselves with love” (Colossians 3:14), and boldness, “We cannot stop speaking” (Acts 4:20). The disciples’ zeal, “They went through the villages, declaring the good news” (Luke 9:6), guides them. Their efforts prepare for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Go, therefore, and make disciples.” —Matthew 28:19</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Boldness in Preaching</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Boldness in preaching reflects Jesus’ command, “Preach the word” (2 Timothy 4:2), despite opposition, “You will be hated” (Matthew 10:22). In 33 CE, Jesus fearlessly taught, “He spoke with authority” (Luke 4:32), proclaiming, “I must declare the good news” (Luke 4:43). Satan intimidates, “The dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah strengthens, “Do not be afraid” (Matthew 10:28). Ministers speak boldly, “We cannot stop speaking” (Acts 4:20), and make disciples, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Peter and John, who defied threats in 33 CE, “We must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29), zealous ministers stand firm, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness” (Acts 4:29), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Cultivating Boldness</h2>
                        <p>Boldness grows through prayer, “Give your servant courage” (Psalm 86:16), and study, “Pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19). Paul’s courage, “I am not ashamed of the good news” (Romans 1:16), inspires. Ministers prepare, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Overcoming Fear</h2>
                        <p>Ministers overcome fear by trusting Jehovah, “Jehovah is my helper” (Hebrews 13:6), and following Jesus’ example, “I have conquered the world” (John 16:33). Their boldness prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“We cannot stop speaking.” —Acts 4:20</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Perseverance in Ministry</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Perseverance in ministry fulfills Jesus’ charge, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), despite trials, “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). In 50 CE, Paul persevered, “I did not shrink from declaring the whole purpose of God” (Acts 20:27). Satan hinders, “The god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah sustains, “I am with you” (Isaiah 41:10). Ministers endure, “Be faithful even to death” (Revelation 2:10), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like the apostles, who “kept on teaching and declaring the good news” (Acts 5:42) in 33 CE, zealous ministers persist, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They rely on Jehovah, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Strengthening Endurance</h2>
                        <p>Endurance grows through association, “Encourage one another” (Hebrews 10:25), and prayer, “Do not stop praying” (1 Thessalonians 5:17). Paul’s resolve, “I have fought the fine fight” (2 Timothy 4:7), inspires. Ministers persevere, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Facing Challenges</h2>
                        <p>Ministers face rejection, “They will persecute you” (John 15:20), but follow Jesus’ example, “He continued teaching” (Mark 10:1). Their perseverance prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one who endures to the end will be saved.” —Matthew 24:13</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Preparation for Preaching</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Preparation equips ministers for zealous preaching, “Be ready in season and out of season” (2 Timothy 4:2), as Jesus taught, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). In 31 CE, Jesus prepared disciples, “He gave them authority” (Luke 9:1), to preach effectively. Satan distracts, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah guides, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105). Ministers study, “This book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Timothy, trained “from infancy” (2 Timothy 3:15) in 50 CE, zealous ministers prepare, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They practice, “Speak truth each one with his neighbor” (Ephesians 4:25), and pray, “Open my eyes” (Psalm 119:18), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Studying Effectively</h2>
                        <p>Effective study involves scripture, “Pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), and meditation, “I will meditate on your orders” (Psalm 119:15). Philip’s readiness, “He declared to him the good news” (Acts 8:35), around 36 CE, inspires. Ministers focus, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Practicing Presentations</h2>
                        <p>Ministers practice to teach clearly, “Let your words be few” (Ecclesiastes 5:2), and persuasively, “Always ready to make a defense” (1 Peter 3:15). Jesus’ clarity, “He taught them as one having authority” (Matthew 7:29), guides them. Their preparation prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Be ready in season and out of season.” —2 Timothy 4:2</p>

                        <p>Love drives zealous ministry, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), reflecting Jehovah’s love, “God is love” (1 John 4:8). In 33 CE, Jesus showed love, “No one has love greater than this” (John 15:13), teaching compassionately. Satan promotes selfishness, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah inspires, “Love one another” (John 13:34). Ministers preach lovingly, “Speak truth each one with his neighbor” (Ephesians 4:25), and share, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like the Samaritan, who helped a stranger in 33 CE, “He acted mercifully” (Luke 10:37), zealous ministers show kindness, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Clothe yourselves with love” (Colossians 3:14), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Showing Compassion</h2>
                        <p>Compassion involves listening, “Speak consolingly to the depressed souls” (1 Thessalonians 5:14), and helping, “Bear one another’s burdens” (Galatians 6:2). The disciples’ care, “They distributed to each as anyone had need” (Acts 4:35), inspires. Ministers love, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Reflecting Jehovah’s Love</h2>
                        <p>Ministers reflect love by serving, “Let us work what is good toward all” (Galatians 6:10), and teaching, “Teaching them to observe all things” (Matthew 28:20). Jesus’ example, “I have given you a model” (John 13:15), guides them. Their love prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Love one another.” —John 13:34</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Informal Witnessing</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Informal witnessing spreads the good news, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), in daily life, “Always ready to make a defense” (1 Peter 3:15). In 33 CE, Jesus taught informally, “He spoke to her about the water of life” (John 4:10), at a well. Satan distracts, “The god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah opens doors, “A large door leading to activity has been opened” (1 Corinthians 16:9). Ministers share zealously, “Proclaiming the good news” (Acts 8:4), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Philip, who witnessed to an Ethiopian in 36 CE, “He declared to him the good news” (Acts 8:35), zealous ministers seize opportunities, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They prepare, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Seizing Opportunities</h2>

The disciples’ zeal, “They filled Jerusalem with their teaching” (Acts 5:28), inspires. Ministers share, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>

Jesus’ approach, “He reasoned with them from the Scriptures” (Luke 24:27), guides them. Their witnessing prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p>

In 31 CE, Jesus trained disciples, “He taught them many things” (Mark 6:34), preparing them to preach. Satan opposes, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah equips, “Pay attention to yourself and to your teaching” (1 Timothy 4:16). Ministers train, “Able to teach” (2 Timothy 2:24), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Paul, who mentored Timothy in 50 CE, “Entrust these things to faithful men” (2 Timothy 2:2), zealous ministers guide others, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They encourage, “Encourage one another” (Hebrews 10:25), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Teaching Effectively</h2>

In 33 CE, disciples rejoiced, “They returned with great joy” (Luke 10:17), after preaching. Satan offers fleeting pleasures, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah rewards, “A joyful heart is good medicine” (Proverbs 17:22). Ministers preach joyfully, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Paul and Silas, who sang in prison in 50 CE, “They were praying and praising God” (Acts 16:25), zealous ministers find joy, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Let my heart rejoice” (Psalm 13:5), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Finding Joy</h2>
