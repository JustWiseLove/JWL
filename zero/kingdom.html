                    <summary class="item-button">Jehovah’s Kingdom</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom is the divine government that will soon end all human rule and restore the earth to its intended paradise, a promise fulfilled through Jesus Christ, who began ruling as King in 1914, as foretold, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed... it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). This Kingdom’s establishment was marked by “the appointed times of the nations” ending (Luke 21:24), calculated from Jerusalem’s fall in 607 BCE through Daniel’s “seven times” (Daniel 4:25)—2,520 years that pinpoint 1914, when wars, famines, and earthquakes surged, fulfilling Jesus’ words, “Nation will rise against nation... there will be food shortages and earthquakes” (Matthew 24:7-8). Jehovah’s purpose is unshakable, as He declares, “My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please” (Isaiah 46:10), ensuring that this Kingdom will “fill the whole earth” (Daniel 2:35). It comprises 144,000 co-rulers with Christ, “bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:1, 3), while a “great crowd” survives Armageddon to inhabit the earth (Revelation 7:9), a dual hope that reflects Jehovah’s mercy and justice.</p>
                        <p>Human governments, from Rome’s collapse in 476 CE to today’s nations, have failed to bring peace, but Jehovah’s Kingdom succeeds where they falter, as “your throne, O God, is forever and ever” (Psalm 45:6). Its signs since 1914—global conflicts like World War I, pandemics like the Spanish Flu—confirm its presence, and Jesus’ parable of the wheat and weeds shows it grows amid opposition until “the harvest,” when “the righteous will shine as brightly as the sun” (Matthew 13:39-43). Jehovah’s past interventions, like toppling Babylon in 539 BCE, “the kingdom was given to the Medes and Persians” (Daniel 5:28), preview this Kingdom’s triumph, for “the kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” (Revelation 11:15). True worshipers pray for its full realization, knowing “your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom” (Psalm 145:13).</p>
                        <h2>Armageddon</h2>
                        <p>Armageddon is Jehovah’s final war against wickedness, “the battle of the great day of God the Almighty” (Revelation 16:14), a climactic event that follows “the great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning” (Matthew 24:21). It will destroy false religion—“Babylon the Great has fallen” (Revelation 18:2)—and evil governments, as “the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war” but are defeated (Revelation 19:19-21). Jehovah’s power was shown when He drowned Egypt’s army, “not one of them remained” (Exodus 14:28), and Armageddon will be even greater, for “he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God” (Revelation 19:15). Survivors will inherit a cleansed earth, where “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3), fulfilling Jehovah’s promise, “Behold, I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5).</p>
                        <h2>1914</h2>
                        <p>The year 1914 marks a pivotal moment in Bible prophecy, when Jesus Christ was enthroned as King of Jehovah’s Kingdom, ending “the appointed times of the nations” (Luke 21:24), a period of Gentile domination that began with Jerusalem’s destruction by Babylon in 607 BCE. This date is calculated from Daniel’s prophecy of “seven times” (Daniel 4:25), where Nebuchadnezzar’s seven-year madness symbolized 2,520 years (using “a day for a year” from Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:6), stretching from 607 BCE to October 1914. That year saw the outbreak of World War I, an unprecedented conflict that killed millions, alongside famines and the 1918 Spanish Flu, fulfilling Jesus’ words, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another” (Matthew 24:7). Jehovah’s purpose advanced, as “the Son of man came on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory” (Matthew 24:30), not visibly but in authority, a reign confirmed by “your throne is established from long ago” (Psalm 93:2).</p>

            <!-- The King Jesus Christ -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">The King Jesus Christ</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jesus Christ is the appointed King of Jehovah’s Kingdom, enthroned in 1914 to fulfill the prophecy, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom... it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). As “the faithful and true witness” (Revelation 3:14) and “the firstborn of all creation” (Colossians 1:15), Jesus was chosen by Jehovah to rule, declared at his baptism, “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved” (Matthew 3:17). His earthly life, preaching “the good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 4:23), and his sacrificial death, “he bore our sins in his own body on the stake” (1 Peter 2:24), qualified him to reign, as Jehovah exalted him, “God kindly gave him the name that is above every other name” (Philippians 2:9). Since 1914, Jesus rules from heaven, “he must rule as king until he has put all enemies under his feet” (1 Corinthians 15:25), preparing for Armageddon, where “he treads the winepress of the wrath of God” (Revelation 19:15). True worshipers honor him as King, praying, “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10), and proclaiming his rule, “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p>Satan opposes Jesus’ kingship, tempting him to worship him, “All these things I will give you” (Matthew 4:9), but Jesus remained loyal, “It is Jehovah your God you must worship” (Matthew 4:10). False religion denies his role, but Jehovah’s Word confirms, “The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” (Revelation 11:15). Jesus’ miracles, like raising Lazarus, “he who had been dead came out” (John 11:44), and his resurrection, “the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20), prove his authority as King, fulfilling Jehovah’s purpose for a paradise earth.</p>
                        <h2>Qualifications for Kingship</h2>
                        <p>Jesus earned his kingship through obedience and sacrifice. He resisted Satan’s temptations, “Get behind me, Satan!” (Matthew 16:23), and fulfilled prophecy, “he was numbered with the transgressors” (Isaiah 53:12). His ransom, “the Son of man came to give his life as a ransom” (Matthew 20:28), opened the way for salvation, “through one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous” (Romans 5:19). Jehovah rewarded his faithfulness, “all authority has been given me in heaven and on earth” (Matthew 28:18), making him the only mediator, “one mediator between God and men” (1 Timothy 2:5).</p>
                        <h2>Future Reign</h2>
                        <p>Jesus’ reign will fully manifest after Armageddon, when “the righteous will shine as brightly as the sun” (Matthew 13:43). He will judge the living and the dead, “he will separate people one from another” (Matthew 25:32), and restore earth, “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). His rule ensures “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24), fulfilling Jehovah’s promise, “I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5). True worshipers submit to him now, “every knee should bend” (Philippians 2:10), preparing for his eternal reign.</p>

            <!-- The 144,000 Co-Rulers -->

                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">The 144,000 Co-Rulers</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom includes 144,000 co-rulers with Christ, chosen from humanity to serve as “a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will rule as kings over the earth” (Revelation 5:10). These “bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:3) are sealed from “every tribe of the sons of Israel” (Revelation 7:4), a symbolic number representing faithful ones from the first century to the last days. They partake of the Memorial emblems, as Jesus said, “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves” (John 6:53), signifying their heavenly calling, “they will be priests of God and of the Christ” (Revelation 20:6). Their selection began with the apostles, “I have chosen you out of the world” (John 15:19), and continues with anointed ones who endure, “the one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). Jehovah’s justice ensures their number is complete, “the full number of those who are sealed” (Revelation 7:4), to rule with Christ over a paradise earth.</p>
                        <p>Satan attacks these anointed, “the dragon became enraged with the woman” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah protects them, “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17). False religion claims all go to heaven, but Scripture limits this hope to the 144,000, while the “great crowd” inherits earth (Revelation 7:9). Their role was foreshadowed when Israel’s priests served, “you will become to me a kingdom of priests” (Exodus 19:6), but only the anointed fulfill this in heaven, “they will see his face” (Revelation 22:4).</p>
                        <h2>Selection Process</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah chooses the 144,000 based on faith and loyalty, as seen in the apostles, “you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones” (Matthew 19:28). They face trials, “counted worthy to be dishonored for the sake of that name” (Acts 5:41), and remain “no part of the world” (John 17:16). Their anointing by holy spirit, “the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit” (Romans 8:16), confirms their calling, a process ongoing since Pentecost 33 CE, when “3,000 were added” (Acts 2:41).</p>
                        <h2>Role in the Kingdom</h2>
                        <p>The 144,000 will administer Jehovah’s Kingdom, judging with Christ, “they will judge the world” (1 Corinthians 6:2), and aiding the “great crowd,” “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). Their heavenly resurrection, “they were raised in the clouds” (1 Thessalonians 4:17), equips them to serve, “they will rule as kings forever and ever” (Revelation 22:5). True worshipers respect their role, supporting the preaching work, “make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19), which prepares earth for their rule.</p>

            <!-- The Great Crowd -->

                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">The Great Crowd</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The “great crowd” is a vast multitude from “all nations and tribes and peoples” (Revelation 7:9) who survive Armageddon to live on a paradise earth, fulfilling Jehovah’s promise, “The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29). Unlike the 144,000, they have an earthly hope, “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and stand “before the throne” by serving Jehovah faithfully, “rendering him sacred service day and night” (Revelation 7:15). They emerge from “the great tribulation” (Revelation 7:14), cleansed by Jesus’ blood, “they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb” (Revelation 7:14). Their faith mirrors Noah’s, who “constructed an ark” (Hebrews 11:7), and Rahab’s, “you have shown loyal love” (Joshua 2:12-14), earning Jehovah’s protection, “he knows how to deliver people of godly devotion” (2 Peter 2:9). True worshipers join this group by preaching, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and obeying, “seek righteousness, seek meekness” (Zephaniah 2:3).</p>
                        <p>Satan seeks to destroy the great crowd, “the dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah shields them, “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). False religion’s heaven-for-all doctrine obscures their hope, but Scripture clarifies, “The earth remains forever” (Ecclesiastes 1:4). Their future is secure, “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24), as Jehovah’s Kingdom fulfills His purpose, “he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18).</p>
                        <h2>Requirements for Survival</h2>
                        <p>The great crowd must exercise faith, “the one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36), and obey, “the one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). They reject false worship, “get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and remain neutral, “my Kingdom is no part of this world” (John 18:36). Their preaching, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), proves their loyalty, as seen in the first century, “they were all scattered, preaching the word” (Acts 8:4).</p>
                        <h2>Life in Paradise</h2>
                        <p>After Armageddon, the great crowd will “build houses and live in them” (Isaiah 65:21), enjoying “a new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). They will learn from the 144,000, “they will be priests of God” (Revelation 20:6), and welcome the resurrected, “those asleep in the dust will wake up” (Daniel 12:2). Their eternal life fulfills Jehovah’s promise, “I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5), a hope true worshipers cherish now.</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">The Last Days</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The “last days” began in 1914, when Jesus was enthroned, marking “critical times hard to deal with” (2 Timothy 3:1), as prophesied, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes” (Matthew 24:7). World War I, the 1918 Spanish Flu, and moral decay—“lovers of themselves” (2 Timothy 3:2)—confirm this period, mirroring Noah’s day, “the earth was filled with violence” (Genesis 6:11). Satan’s expulsion from heaven, “the dragon was hurled down to the earth” (Revelation 12:9), intensified woes, “woe to the earth” (Revelation 12:12). Jehovah’s Kingdom advances through preaching, “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth” (Matthew 24:14), a sign of “the end” (Matthew 24:14). True worshipers heed the warning, “The great day of Jehovah is near” (Zephaniah 1:14), seeking “Jehovah while he may be found” (Isaiah 55:6).</p>
                        <p>Satan blinds humanity to these signs, “the god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s prophecies are clear. The increase in wars, famines, and “earthquakes in one place after another” (Matthew 24:7) since 1914, alongside global preaching, prove “all these things are a beginning of pangs of distress” (Matthew 24:8). False religion ignores this, but Jehovah’s servants proclaim, “Pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19).</p>
                        <h2>Signs of the Times</h2>
                        <p>Jesus outlined last-days signs: wars, “you will hear of wars and reports of wars” (Matthew 24:6); famines, “there will be food shortages” (Matthew 24:7); and moral decline, “the love of the greater number will grow cold” (Matthew 24:12). History confirms this—World War II, the Great Depression’s hunger, and rising crime since 1914 align with “critical times” (2 Timothy 3:1). The preaching work, reaching billions, fulfills “a witness to all the nations” (Matthew 24:14), a unique sign of Jehovah’s purpose.</p>
                        <h2>Preparation for the End</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah calls His servants to prepare, “seek righteousness, seek meekness” (Zephaniah 2:3), by studying, “this book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), and preaching, “make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). The first century saw similar urgency, “they continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42). Today, true worshipers remain vigilant, “keep on the watch” (Matthew 24:42), trusting “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion” (2 Peter 2:9).</p>

                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Prophetic Evidence</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s prophecies prove His Kingdom’s reality, as “not one of all the good promises Jehovah made to the house of Israel failed” (Joshua 21:45). Daniel’s vision of a statue—gold, silver, bronze, iron, and clay (Daniel 2:31-44)—traced world powers from Babylon to Rome, ending with a divided modern era struck by “the stone” of God’s Kingdom in 1914, “it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). Ezekiel’s prophecy, “I will overturn, overturn, overturn it... until he comes whose right it is” (Ezekiel 21:27), pointed to Christ’s enthronement, confirmed by 1914’s war, which shattered empires like Russia and Austria-Hungary. Isaiah named Cyrus 200 years before his birth, “saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd’” (Isaiah 44:28), fulfilled in 539 BCE when he freed Israel, “the word of Jehovah was fulfilled” (Ezra 1:1). These proofs silence doubters, urging true worshipers to “pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), as “the word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <p>Satan obscures these prophecies, “blinding the minds of the unbelievers” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s Word prevails. Tyre’s ruin, “I will make you a bare rock” (Ezekiel 26:4), fulfilled by Alexander in 332 BCE, and Jerusalem’s 70-year desolation, “until the land had paid off its sabbaths” (2 Chronicles 36:21), show His precision. The Dead Sea Scrolls, dated to 200 BCE, preserve these prophecies, refuting claims of alteration. True worshipers proclaim this evidence, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <h2>Historical Confirmations</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s prophecies align with history: Babylon’s fall, “it will never be inhabited” (Isaiah 13:20), remains desolate; the Cyrus Cylinder, from 539 BCE, confirms Israel’s release; and Jerusalem’s fall in 607 BCE, “the land will be desolate” (Jeremiah 25:11), lasted exactly 70 years. The 1914 prophecy, “seven times” (Daniel 4:25), saw World War I erupt, fulfilling “nation will rise against nation” (Matthew 24:7). These events prove “Jehovah is God; there is no other” (Deuteronomy 4:35).</p>
                        <h2>Future Fulfillment</h2>
                        <p>Prophecies yet to be fulfilled include Armageddon, “the battle of the great day” (Revelation 16:14), and the resurrection, “those in the memorial tombs will come out” (John 5:28-29). The Kingdom will bring “a new heavens and a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). True worshipers trust this, “heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away” (Matthew 24:35), and prepare by preaching, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19).</p>

                        <p>The great tribulation is an unprecedented period of distress preceding Armageddon, “such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now” (Matthew 24:21), when Jehovah’s Kingdom will destroy false religion and human governments. It begins with the fall of “Babylon the Great,” false religion, “in one day her plagues will come” (Revelation 18:8), as “the kings of the earth” turn against her (Revelation 17:16). This triggers global chaos, “nations were in anguish” (Luke 21:25), but Jehovah protects His servants, “seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be that you will be concealed” (Zephaniah 2:3). The tribulation culminates in Armageddon, “the battle of the great day of God the Almighty” (Revelation 16:14), where “the kings of the earth and their armies” are defeated (Revelation 19:19-21). True worshipers prepare by preaching, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and remaining faithful, “the one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13).</p>
                        <p>Satan fuels this tribulation, “woe to the earth, because the devil has come down to you” (Revelation 12:12), inciting rebellion against Jehovah’s people, “the dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17). False religion’s collapse exposes its lies, “she has become a dwelling place of demons” (Revelation 18:2), but Jehovah’s Kingdom stands firm, “your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom” (Psalm 145:13). The tribulation’s severity echoes past judgments, like the Flood, “every living thing was wiped out” (Genesis 7:23), but offers hope, “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3).</p>
                        <h2>Stages of the Tribulation</h2>
                        <p>The tribulation unfolds in phases: first, false religion’s destruction, “Babylon the Great has fallen” (Revelation 18:2); then, global distress, “men become faint out of fear” (Luke 21:26); and finally, Armageddon, “he treads the winepress of the wrath” (Revelation 19:15). Jehovah’s past acts, like drowning Pharaoh’s army, “not one of them remained” (Exodus 14:28), foreshadow this sequence. His servants are spared, as Noah was, “Jehovah shut the door” (Genesis 7:16), ensuring “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17).</p>
                        <h2>Survival Through Faith</h2>
                        <p>Surviving the tribulation requires faith, “the one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36), and obedience, “keep on the watch” (Matthew 24:42). The great crowd endures, “they have washed their robes” (Revelation 7:14), by rejecting false worship, “get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and preaching, “make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). Jehovah promises protection, “he knows how to deliver people of godly devotion” (2 Peter 2:9), leading to “a new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>

            <!-- Paradise Restored -->

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom will restore earth to a paradise, fulfilling His original purpose, “he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18), where “the righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29). After Armageddon, “the wicked will be no more” (Psalm 37:10), the great crowd and resurrected ones will inhabit a world where “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24), and “the wolf will reside with the lamb” (Isaiah 11:6). Jesus’ ransom, “you were bought with a price” (1 Peter 1:18-19), reverses Adam’s curse, “cursed is the ground” (Genesis 3:17), restoring Eden’s perfection, “he planted a garden in Eden” (Genesis 2:8). True worshipers pray for this, “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10), and preach its certainty, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). The earth’s design—its oxygen, soil, and water—confirms it as humanity’s home, “the earth remains forever” (Ecclesiastes 1:4).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s lies, like heaven as the only hope, obscure this truth, “the god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s Word prevails, “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5). Past miracles, like Lazarus’ raising, “he who had been dead came out” (John 11:44), preview this restoration. The Kingdom’s rule ensures “they will build houses and live in them” (Isaiah 65:21), a tangible future where “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <h2>Features of Paradise</h2>
                        <p>Paradise will feature peace, “they will not learn war anymore” (Isaiah 2:4); health, “the eyes of the blind will be opened” (Isaiah 35:5); and abundance, “the earth will yield its produce” (Psalm 67:6). The resurrection, “those in the memorial tombs will come out” (John 5:28-29), reunites families, and the 144,000 guide, “they will be priests” (Revelation 20:6). This fulfills Jehovah’s promise, “I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5), a world without “death or mourning or pain” (Revelation 21:4).</p>
                        <h2>Human Role</h2>
                        <p>Humans prepare for paradise by faith, “the righteous one will live by reason of faith” (Habakkuk 2:4), and obedience, “keep my commandments and live” (Proverbs 7:2). Preaching, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), and living morally, “be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16), align with Jehovah’s purpose. Israel’s blessings for obedience, “Jehovah will bless you” (Deuteronomy 28:2), foreshadow the great crowd’s reward, “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3).</p>
