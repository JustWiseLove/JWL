            <!-- Moral Purity -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Moral Purity</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Living a morally pure life reflects Jehovah’s holy standards, as He commands, “This is the will of God, that you should be holy, for you should abstain from sexual immorality” (1 Thessalonians 4:3). Sexual immorality, including fornication, adultery, and homosexuality, defiles the body, which is “a temple of the holy spirit” (1 Corinthians 6:19). Jehovah struck Israel’s immoral men with death, “Jehovah’s anger blazed against them” (Numbers 25:3), around 1473 BCE, showing His hatred for such sins. Pornography, a modern plague, fuels lustful thoughts, but Jesus warned, “Everyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart” (Matthew 5:28). Unclean habits like drug abuse or drunkenness also dishonor Jehovah, as “drunkards will not inherit God’s Kingdom” (1 Corinthians 6:10). True worshipers maintain purity, “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Corinthians 6:18), and seek Jehovah’s help through prayer, “Create in me a clean heart, O God” (Psalm 51:10), ensuring their lives honor Him and align with His purpose for a paradise earth, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s world promotes immorality, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), through media and culture, but Jehovah’s standards are absolute, “Be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16). False religion often excuses sin, but Jehovah’s Word condemns it, as seen when He destroyed Sodom for “gross sexual immorality” (Jude 7), around 1918 BCE. True worshipers reject these lies, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and guard their hearts, “Above all things, guard your heart” (Proverbs 4:23). By living purely, they reflect Jehovah’s qualities, “Be imitators of God, as beloved children” (Ephesians 5:1), and prepare for His Kingdom, where “No unclean thing will enter” (Isaiah 52:1).</p>
                        <h2>Guarding the Mind</h2>
                        <p>Moral purity begins in the mind, as “Out of the heart come wicked reasonings” (Matthew 15:19). Avoiding pornography and immoral entertainment, “Whatever is true, whatever is of serious concern, whatever is righteous” (Philippians 4:8), protects thoughts. Joseph fled Potiphar’s wife, “How could I commit this great evil and actually sin against God?” (Genesis 39:9), around 1711 BCE, setting an example. Regular study, “This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth” (Joshua 1:8), and prayer, “Do not bring us into temptation” (Matthew 6:13), strengthen resolve, ensuring “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Practical Steps</h2>
                        <p>True worshipers take action: avoiding tempting situations, “Do not turn aside to the right or to the left” (Proverbs 4:27); seeking help from elders, “The way of the righteous is made straight” (Isaiah 26:7); and relying on Jehovah, “He will make your paths straight” (Proverbs 3:6). The first century saw Christians flee immorality, “They turned to God from idols” (1 Thessalonians 1:9), and today, millions uphold purity, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>

            <!-- Modesty in Dress -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Modesty in Dress</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Modesty in dress honors Jehovah, reflecting His dignity and holiness, as Scripture instructs, “Women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress, with modesty and soundness of mind” (1 Timothy 2:9). Clothing should be respectful, clean, and not draw undue attention, avoiding tight, revealing, or flashy styles that reflect Satan’s world, “Do not let your adornment be external” (1 Peter 3:3). Jehovah judged Israel’s prideful women, “Jehovah will make the heads of the daughters of Zion scabby” (Isaiah 3:17), around 740 BCE, for vain attire, showing His disapproval. Modest dress glorifies Jehovah, “Do all things for God’s glory” (1 Corinthians 10:31), and protects moral purity, “Guard your heart” (Proverbs 4:23). True worshipers choose attire suitable for worship and daily life, “Be holy in all your conduct” (1 Peter 1:15), ensuring their appearance reflects their devotion, “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s world promotes immodesty, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), through fashion that exalts self, but Jehovah’s standards prevail, “Let your light shine before men” (Matthew 5:16). False religion often ignores modesty, but true worshipers reject vanity, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians dressed simply, “With modesty and soundness of mind” (1 Timothy 2:9), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Modesty prepares them for Jehovah’s Kingdom, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), where “Righteousness will dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Respecting Worship</h2>
                        <p>Modesty is vital at meetings and preaching, “Not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25), where attire should reflect reverence, “Worship Jehovah in holy array” (Psalm 96:9). Neat, clean clothing honors Jehovah, as seen when Israel prepared for worship, “Sanctify yourselves and wash your garments” (Exodus 19:10), around 1513 BCE. Avoiding worldly fads, “Do not be conformed to this system of things” (Romans 12:2), ensures focus on spiritual matters, “Seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33).</p>
                        <h2>Cultural Sensitivity</h2>
                        <p>Modesty varies by culture, but Jehovah’s principles are universal, “God is not partial” (Acts 10:34). True worshipers adapt to local norms while upholding decency, “Becoming all things to people of all sorts” (1 Corinthians 9:22). They avoid extremes, “Let your reasonableness become known” (Philippians 4:5), and prioritize heart condition, “Man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees what the heart is” (1 Samuel 16:7). This prepares them for paradise, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress, with modesty and soundness of mind.” —1 Timothy 2:9</p>

            <!-- Wholesome Speech -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Wholesome Speech</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Wholesome speech reflects Jehovah’s love and truth, as Scripture urges, “Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt” (Colossians 4:6). True worshipers use kind, truthful, and upbuilding words, “Let your speech always be with graciousness” (Ephesians 4:29), avoiding gossip, slander, or crude talk, which dishonor Jehovah, “A slanderer will not be established in the earth” (Psalm 140:11). When Miriam gossiped against Moses, “Jehovah’s anger blazed against her” (Numbers 12:9), around 1473 BCE, showing His hatred for harmful speech. Speech should build faith, “Encourage one another” (1 Thessalonians 5:11), and glorify Jehovah, “Offer to God a sacrifice of praise” (Hebrews 13:15). True worshipers guard their tongues, “The one guarding his mouth preserves his life” (Proverbs 13:3), ensuring their words align with Jehovah’s purpose, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s world promotes vile speech, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), through media and crude humor, but Jehovah’s standards are clear, “Let corrupt communication not come out of your mouth” (Ephesians 4:29). False religion often tolerates gossip, but true worshipers reject it, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians spoke boldly, “Proclaiming the good news” (Acts 8:4), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Wholesome speech prepares them for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p>
                        <h2>Building Others Up</h2>
                        <p>Speech should encourage, “Speak consolingly to the depressed souls” (1 Thessalonians 5:14), as Paul did, “Strengthening the souls of the disciples” (Acts 14:22). Avoiding gossip, “Do not spread a bad report” (Exodus 23:1), and crude humor, “Obscene jesting is not proper” (Ephesians 5:4), reflects love, “Love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:39). True worshipers use words to preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), ensuring “The tongue of the wise brings healing” (Proverbs 12:18).</p>
                        <h2>Controlling the Tongue</h2>
                        <p>Controlling speech requires effort, “The tongue is a fire” (James 3:6). Prayer, “Set a guard, O Jehovah, over my mouth” (Psalm 141:3), and study, “My mouth will speak wisdom” (Psalm 49:3), help. David’s example, “I will guard my mouth” (Psalm 39:1), inspires vigilance. True worshipers avoid harmful words, “Put away all malicious bitterness” (Ephesians 4:31), and speak truth, “Speak truth each one with his neighbor” (Ephesians 4:25), preparing for “A new earth” where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt.” —Colossians 4:6</p>

            <!-- Healthy Associations -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Healthy Associations</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Choosing healthy associations strengthens faith, as Scripture warns, “He who walks with wise people will become wise, but he who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly” (Proverbs 13:20). Friends should support spiritual goals, “Bad associations spoil useful habits” (1 Corinthians 15:33), avoiding those who reject Jehovah’s standards, “Do not be misled” (1 Corinthians 15:33). When Israel mingled with pagans, “They adopted their customs” (2 Kings 17:8), around 740 BCE, Jehovah punished them, “I disciplined them” (Hosea 10:10). True worshipers seek companions who love Jehovah, “I am a friend to all who fear you” (Psalm 119:63), and build faith, “Encourage one another” (Hebrews 10:24). This ensures alignment with Jehovah’s purpose, “A people for his name” (Acts 15:14), and prepares for paradise, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s world promotes harmful associations, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah’s people remain separate, “No part of the world” (John 17:16). False religion mixes with unbelievers, but true worshipers reject this, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians chose faithful friends, “They continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Healthy associations fortify them for Jehovah’s Kingdom, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <h2>Choosing Faithful Friends</h2>
                        <p>Friends should share Jehovah’s values, “Can two walk together unless they are in agreement?” (Amos 3:3). Meetings provide such companions, “Not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25), as seen when Ruth chose Naomi, “Your people will be my people” (Ruth 1:16), around 1100 BCE. Avoiding worldly peers, “Do not be conformed to this system of things” (Romans 12:2), protects faith, “The one walking with the wise will become wise” (Proverbs 13:20).</p>
                        <h2>Positive Influence</h2>
                        <p>Healthy associations uplift, “As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another” (Proverbs 27:17). True worshipers encourage preaching, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and endurance, “The one who endures to the end” (Matthew 24:13). Paul’s companions, like Timothy, strengthened him, “A genuine child in the faith” (1 Timothy 1:2). Choosing such friends ensures “The way of the righteous is made straight” (Isaiah 26:7), preparing for “A new earth” where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“He who walks with wise people will become wise.” —Proverbs 13:20</p>

            <!-- Balanced Recreation -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Balanced Recreation</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Balanced recreation refreshes true worshipers without compromising Jehovah’s standards, as Scripture urges, “Whatever is true, whatever is of serious concern, whatever is righteous, think about these things” (Philippians 4:8). Clean fun, like family activities or nature, honors Jehovah, “Do all things for God’s glory” (1 Corinthians 10:31), while avoiding worldly excesses, “The world is passing away” (1 John 2:17). Israel’s feasts, like the Festival of Booths, “You must rejoice before Jehovah” (Leviticus 23:40), around 1513 BCE, showed joyful rest. Physical exercise, “Bodily training is beneficial” (1 Timothy 4:8), supports health, but spiritual priorities come first, “Seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33). True worshipers choose recreation that uplifts, “Be holy in all your conduct” (1 Peter 1:15), preparing for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s world promotes immoral entertainment, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), like violent games or impure shows, but Jehovah’s standards reject these, “Abhor what is wicked” (Romans 12:9). False religion often indulges in excess, but true worshipers avoid it, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians found joy in fellowship, “They continued devoting themselves to breaking bread” (Acts 2:42), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Balanced recreation strengthens them for Jehovah’s Kingdom, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <h2>Choosing Clean Fun</h2>
                        <p>Recreation should align with Jehovah’s principles, “Whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable” (Philippians 4:8). Family outings, music, or sports, if clean, refresh, “A joyful heart is good medicine” (Proverbs 17:22). Avoiding immoral media, “Do not be conformed to this system of things” (Romans 12:2), mirrors Daniel’s resolve, “He refused to defile himself” (Daniel 1:8), around 617 BCE. True worshipers prioritize spiritual activities, “This book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), ensuring “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Maintaining Balance</h2>
                        <p>Recreation must not overshadow spiritual goals, “The time left is reduced” (1 Corinthians 7:29). Moderation, “Let your reasonableness become known” (Philippians 4:5), prevents obsession, as Solomon warned, “I said to myself, ‘Come, test out pleasure’... it was vanity” (Ecclesiastes 2:1-2). True worshipers balance fun with preaching, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and worship, “Not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25), preparing for “A new earth” where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Whatever is true, whatever is of serious concern, whatever is righteous, think about these things.” —Philippians 4:8</p>

            <!-- Spiritual Routine -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Spiritual Routine</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>A spiritual routine strengthens faith, as Scripture urges, “His delight is in the law of Jehovah, and he reads His law in an undertone day and night” (Psalm 1:2). True worshipers maintain personal study, “This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth” (Joshua 1:8); family worship, “Train a boy in the way he should go” (Proverbs 22:6); meeting attendance, “Not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:24-25); and preaching, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). These habits sustained Daniel, who prayed “three times a day” (Daniel 6:10), around 539 BCE, despite threats. They fortify against Satan’s attacks, “Put on the complete suit of armor from God” (Ephesians 6:11), and align with Jehovah’s purpose, “A people for his name” (Acts 15:14). True worshipers prioritize these, “Seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33), preparing for “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s world distracts from spiritual routines, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah’s standards demand diligence, “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching” (1 Timothy 4:16). False religion neglects Bible study, but true worshipers reject this, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians met regularly, “They continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). A spiritual routine ensures readiness for Jehovah’s Kingdom, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <h2>Building Faith</h2>
                        <p>Personal study deepens knowledge, “My mouth will speak wisdom” (Psalm 49:3), as Timothy studied, “Handling the word of truth aright” (2 Timothy 2:15). Family worship unites, “You and your household will be saved” (Acts 16:31), and meetings encourage, “Encourage one another” (Hebrews 10:25). Preaching saves, “I am clean from the blood of all men” (Acts 20:26). These habits, like Ezra’s study, “Ezra prepared his heart to consult the Law” (Ezra 7:10), around 455 BCE, build faith, “The righteous one will live by reason of faith” (Habakkuk 2:4).</p>
                        <h2>Overcoming Obstacles</h2>
                        <p>Busyness and opposition challenge routines, but Jehovah provides strength, “He gives power to the tired one” (Isaiah 40:29). Prayer, “Do not stop praying” (1 Thessalonians 5:17), and discipline, “Let your reasonableness become known” (Philippians 4:5), help. True worshipers persist, as Paul did, “We do not give up” (2 Corinthians 4:1), ensuring “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). This prepares them for “A new earth” where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Not forsaking our meeting together.” —Hebrews 10:24-25</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Responsible Work Ethic</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>A responsible work ethic honors Jehovah, as Scripture states, “Every man should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work. It is the gift of God” (Ecclesiastes 3:13). True worshipers are honest, diligent workers, “Let the thief no longer steal, but let him do hard work” (Ephesians 4:28), avoiding laziness, “The idle one is in want” (Proverbs 19:15). They reject materialism, “The love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things” (1 Timothy 6:10), trusting Jehovah’s care, “Your Father knows what you need” (Matthew 6:8). Joseph’s diligence, “Jehovah was with him” (Genesis 39:2), around 1711 BCE, brought blessings. Work glorifies Jehovah, “Do all things for God’s glory” (1 Corinthians 10:31), and supports spiritual goals, “Seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33), preparing for “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s world promotes greed and dishonesty, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah’s standards demand integrity, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18). False religion often chases wealth, but true worshipers reject this, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians worked diligently, “Working with our hands” (1 Corinthians 4:12), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). A responsible work ethic ensures readiness for Jehovah’s Kingdom, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <h2>Honesty in Work</h2>
                        <p>Honesty reflects Jehovah’s truth, “Let your Yes mean Yes” (Matthew 5:37). True worshipers avoid cheating, “Do not use dishonest standards” (Leviticus 19:35), as Zacchaeus repented, “I will pay back four times over” (Luke 19:8), around 31 CE. Diligence, “Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might” (Ecclesiastes 9:10), honors Jehovah, “Work as to Jehovah and not to men” (Colossians 3:23). This ensures “Jehovah will bless you” (Deuteronomy 28:2).</p>
                        <h2>Avoiding Materialism</h2>
                        <p>Materialism distracts, “You cannot slave for God and for Riches” (Matthew 6:24). True worshipers live simply, “Having food and clothing, we will be content” (1 Timothy 6:8), trusting Jehovah, “He will not abandon his loyal ones” (Psalm 37:28). Solomon’s excess, “All of it was vanity” (Ecclesiastes 2:11), warns against greed. Prioritizing spiritual riches, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), prepares for “A new earth” where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Personal cleanliness reflects Jehovah’s holiness, as Scripture urges, “Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God” (2 Corinthians 7:1). True worshipers maintain physical hygiene, “Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean” (Isaiah 1:16), and respect health, “Bodily training is beneficial” (1 Timothy 4:8). Israel’s cleansing before worship, “Wash your garments” (Exodus 19:10), around 1513 BCE, set a standard. Cleanliness honors Jehovah, “Do all things for God’s glory” (1 Corinthians 10:31), and prepares for service, “Sanctify yourselves” (Leviticus 20:7). It reflects inner purity, “Create in me a clean heart” (Psalm 51:10), aligning with Jehovah’s purpose, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s world neglects holiness, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah’s standards demand cleanliness, “Be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16). False religion ignores hygiene’s spiritual link, but true worshipers reject this, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The first century Christians maintained purity, “They turned to God from idols” (1 Thessalonians 1:9), and today, millions follow, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Cleanliness prepares for Jehovah’s Kingdom, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <h2>Health and Hygiene</h2>
                        <p>Cleanliness includes grooming, “Wash yourselves” (Isaiah 1:16), and healthy habits, “A sound mind in a sound body” (3 John 2). Avoiding harmful substances, “Drunkards will not inherit God’s Kingdom” (1 Corinthians 6:10), mirrors Daniel’s choice, “He refused to defile himself” (Daniel 1:8), around 617 BCE. True worshipers care for their bodies, “Your body is a temple” (1 Corinthians 6:19), ensuring “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Spiritual Cleanliness</h2>
                        <p>Cleanliness reflects holiness, “Cleanse your hands, you sinners” (James 4:8). Study, “This book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), and prayer, “Create in me a clean heart” (Psalm 51:10), purify the heart. True worshipers avoid moral defilement, “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Corinthians 6:18), and serve cleanly, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). This prepares for paradise, “No unclean thing will enter” (Isaiah 52:1), where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
