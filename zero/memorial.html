                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The Memorial of Christ’s death, observed annually on Nisan 14, is the most sacred event for true worshipers, commemorating Jesus’ sacrifice that provides salvation, as he said, “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf” (Luke 22:20). Instituted in 33 CE during the Passover, Jesus replaced the lamb with unleavened bread and wine, symbols of his body and blood, instructing, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19). This event fulfills Jehovah’s purpose, “By means of him we have the release by ransom through his blood” (Ephesians 1:7), offering life to obedient mankind, “The Son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:28). Only the 144,000 anointed partake of the emblems, “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves” (John 6:53), while millions attend to show gratitude, “Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to Jehovah your God” (Deuteronomy 16:1). The date, tied to the Jewish lunar calendar, ensures precision, as “Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed” (1 Corinthians 5:7).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s false religions distort this event with pagan rituals like Easter, blending Christ’s resurrection with fertility rites traced to Babylon around 2000 BCE, but Jehovah’s Word clarifies, “You cannot be partaking of the table of Jehovah and the table of demons” (1 Corinthians 10:21). The Memorial’s simplicity—bread, wine, prayer—rejects such lies, reflecting Jesus’ humility, “He poured out his life even to death” (Isaiah 53:12). Its annual observance, like the Passover’s deliverance from Egypt in 1513 BCE, “This day will serve as a memorial for you” (Exodus 12:14), underscores Jehovah’s mercy, “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son” (John 3:16). True worshipers prepare diligently, “Let us celebrate the festival, not with old leaven, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8), honoring Christ’s sacrifice that upholds Jehovah’s justice and love.</p>
                        <h2>Passover Connection</h2>
                        <p>The Memorial is rooted in the Passover, established when Jehovah spared Israel’s firstborn in Egypt, “When I see the blood, I will pass over you” (Exodus 12:13), a deliverance celebrated annually, “You must keep it as a festival to Jehovah” (Exodus 12:14). Jesus, “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29), fulfilled this type, dying on Nisan 14, 33 CE, as “our Passover lamb” (1 Corinthians 5:7). The bread and wine replace the lamb, signifying his perfect sacrifice, “By one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14). This connection shows Jehovah’s consistent purpose, “I am Jehovah; I do not change” (Malachi 3:6), linking past deliverance to future salvation, “Through him you believe in God, who raised him up from the dead” (1 Peter 1:21).</p>
                        <h2>Anointed Participation</h2>
                        <p>Only the 144,000, sealed for heavenly life, partake of the Memorial emblems, as Jesus told his apostles, “Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day” (John 6:54). Their partaking signifies their role as co-rulers, “They will be priests of God and of the Christ” (Revelation 20:6), confirmed by the spirit, “The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children” (Romans 8:16). Others attend to observe, showing faith, “The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36), and gratitude for the ransom, “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20). This distinction refutes false teachings that all partake, ensuring “we must all appear before the judgment seat of the Christ” (2 Corinthians 5:10).</p>

            <!-- The Ransom Sacrifice -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">The Ransom Sacrifice</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of Jehovah’s provision for salvation, as “the Son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:28). By dying on Nisan 14, 33 CE, Jesus offered a perfect human life to balance Adam’s sin, “Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin” (Romans 5:12), fulfilling Jehovah’s justice, “The soul who sins is the one who will die” (Ezekiel 18:4). This sacrifice, “a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 2:2), opens the way for forgiveness and eternal life, “By means of him we have the release by ransom through his blood” (Ephesians 1:7). It benefits both the 144,000, who gain heavenly life, “bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:3), and the great crowd, who inherit earth, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29). True worshipers honor this during the Memorial, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19), reflecting gratitude, “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son” (John 3:16).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s lies, like salvation through works or pagan rituals, obscure the ransom’s value, but Jehovah’s Word exposes them, “You cannot be partaking of the table of Jehovah and the table of demons” (1 Corinthians 10:21). The ransom’s power is seen in past types, like the Passover lamb, “When I see the blood, I will pass over you” (Exodus 12:13), and confirmed by Jesus’ resurrection, “The firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20). False religion’s hellfire doctrine denies the ransom’s purpose, but Jehovah’s mercy ensures “everlasting life to those who obey him” (Hebrews 5:9). True worshipers live by its benefits, “Through one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous” (Romans 5:19).</p>
                        <h2>Justice and Mercy</h2>
                        <p>The ransom satisfies Jehovah’s justice, “The wages sin pays is death” (Romans 6:23), by providing a perfect substitute, “He bore our sins in his own body on the stake” (1 Peter 2:24). It also reveals His mercy, “He does not desire anyone to be destroyed” (2 Peter 3:9), offering salvation to all who exercise faith, “The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36). This balance is seen in Israel’s atonement day, “Make atonement for the house of Israel” (Leviticus 16:34), a type of Christ’s greater sacrifice, “By one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14).</p>
                        <h2>Application Today</h2>
                        <p>True worshipers apply the ransom by faith, “We have been declared righteous through faith” (Romans 5:1), and obedience, “The one doing the will of my Father” (Matthew 7:21). They reject false teachings, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and preach its benefits, “Make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19). The first century saw thousands accept this, “About 3,000 were added” (Acts 2:41), and today, millions prepare for the Memorial, “Let us celebrate the festival with sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8), trusting “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The Son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many.” —Matthew 20:28</p>

            <!-- The New Covenant -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">The New Covenant</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The new covenant, instituted by Jesus at the Memorial, is Jehovah’s provision for the 144,000 to serve as kings and priests in His Kingdom, as Jesus said, “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood” (Luke 22:20). Foretold by Jeremiah, “I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel... I will put my law in their hearts” (Jeremiah 31:31, 33), it replaced the Mosaic Law, “He has made the first obsolete” (Hebrews 8:13), offering forgiveness through Christ’s sacrifice, “By one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14). The anointed, “bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:3), partake of the Memorial emblems, confirming their role, “They will be priests of God and of the Christ” (Revelation 20:6). This covenant ensures their heavenly resurrection, “We shall all be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:51), to rule with Christ, “They will rule as kings over the earth” (Revelation 5:10). True worshipers honor this covenant by supporting the anointed, “Make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), and living by its principles, “Love is the law’s fulfillment” (Romans 13:10).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s false religions misrepresent the new covenant, claiming all are included, but Scripture limits it to the 144,000, “A kingdom and priests to our God” (Revelation 5:10). The Mosaic Law’s sacrifices, “The blood of bulls and goats” (Hebrews 10:4), were types of Christ’s perfect sacrifice, “A propitiatory sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 2:2). False teachings like universal salvation deny Jehovah’s purpose, but the new covenant’s benefits extend indirectly to the great crowd through the anointed’s rule, “The tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). The first century saw its start, “They continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42), and today, true worshipers uphold it, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19).</p>
                        <h2>Role of the Anointed</h2>
                        <p>The 144,000, under the new covenant, are sealed by holy spirit, “The spirit itself bears witness” (Romans 8:16), and prepared through trials, “Counted worthy to be dishonored” (Acts 5:41). Their role as priests benefits humanity, “They will be priests of God” (Revelation 20:6), guiding the great crowd in paradise, “No resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24). Their kingship ensures justice, “They will judge the world” (1 Corinthians 6:2), fulfilling Jehovah’s promise, “My purpose will stand” (Isaiah 46:10).</p>
                        <h2>Benefits for Mankind</h2>
                        <p>While only the anointed are in the new covenant, its blessings reach the great crowd, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29), through Christ’s ransom, “Everlasting life to those who obey him” (Hebrews 5:9). The covenant’s law, written on hearts, promotes love, “You must love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:39). True worshipers support this by preaching, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and living faithfully, “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13), preparing for “A new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood.” —Luke 22:20</p>

            <!-- The Passover Fulfillment -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">The Passover Fulfillment</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Jesus’ death on Nisan 14, 33 CE, fulfilled the Passover, established in 1513 BCE when Jehovah spared Israel’s firstborn, “When I see the blood, I will pass over you” (Exodus 12:13). As “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29), Jesus replaced the Passover lamb, “Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed” (1 Corinthians 5:7), his blood providing salvation, “By means of him we have the release by ransom through his blood” (Ephesians 1:7). The Memorial commemorates this fulfillment, with bread and wine symbolizing his body and blood, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19). This event ties Jehovah’s past deliverance, “I brought you out of Egypt” (Exodus 12:51), to His future purpose, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29). True worshipers observe the Memorial, “Let us celebrate the festival with sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8), honoring Jehovah’s consistent purpose, “I am Jehovah; I do not change” (Malachi 3:6).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s pagan festivals, like Easter, rooted in Babylonian rites from 2000 BCE, obscure this truth, but Jehovah’s Word refutes them, “You cannot be partaking of the table of Jehovah and the table of demons” (1 Corinthians 10:21). The Passover’s annual observance, “A memorial for you throughout your generations” (Exodus 12:14), foreshadowed the Memorial’s simplicity, rejecting false rituals. Jesus’ perfect sacrifice, “By one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14), surpasses the Passover, offering eternal life, “The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36). True worshipers reject lies, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and prepare diligently, “Observe the month of Abib” (Deuteronomy 16:1).</p>
                        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                        <p>The Passover marked Israel’s deliverance from Egypt, “Jehovah struck every firstborn” (Exodus 12:29), a type of Christ’s greater deliverance, “He bore our sins” (1 Peter 2:24). The lamb’s blood, “Not a bone of it will you break” (Exodus 12:46), prefigured Jesus, “Not a bone of his will be broken” (John 19:36). Archaeological finds, like Egyptian records of plagues, support the Exodus account, confirming Jehovah’s power, “I am Jehovah your God” (Exodus 6:7). The Memorial continues this legacy, “A festival to Jehovah” (Exodus 12:14), linking past and present salvation.</p>
                        <h2>Spiritual Significance</h2>
                        <p>The Passover’s fulfillment in Christ deepens its meaning, “Our Passover lamb has been sacrificed” (1 Corinthians 5:7), offering forgiveness, “Their sins I will remember no more” (Hebrews 8:12). The Memorial calls for reflection, “Examine yourselves” (1 Corinthians 11:28), and gratitude, “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20). True worshipers preach this truth, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), preparing for paradise, “The tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3), where “Death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">The Anointed’s Role</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The 144,000 anointed, chosen to partake in the Memorial, are Jehovah’s “kingdom and priests” (Revelation 5:10), sealed for heavenly life to rule with Christ, “They will rule as kings over the earth” (Revelation 5:10). Their partaking of the bread and wine, “Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life” (John 6:54), confirms their calling, “The spirit itself bears witness” (Romans 8:16). Selected since 33 CE, “I have chosen you out of the world” (John 15:19), they endure trials, “Counted worthy to be dishonored” (Acts 5:41), to serve as co-rulers, “They will be priests of God and of the Christ” (Revelation 20:6). Their role supports Jehovah’s purpose, “My purpose will stand” (Isaiah 46:10), guiding the great crowd in paradise, “The tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). True worshipers respect their role, supporting the preaching work, “Make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), and honoring the Memorial, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19).</p>
                        <p>Satan attacks the anointed, “The dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah protects them, “No weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17). False religion claims all partake, but Scripture restricts this to the 144,000, “Bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:3). Their role was foreshadowed by Israel’s priests, “A kingdom of priests” (Exodus 19:6), but only the anointed fulfill this in heaven, “They will see his face” (Revelation 22:4). The first century saw their selection begin, “About 3,000 were added” (Acts 2:41), and today, true worshipers uphold their work, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <h2>Selection and Trials</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah chooses the anointed for their faith, “You who have followed me” (Matthew 19:28), and loyalty, “The one who endures to the end” (Matthew 24:13). They face persecution, as Paul did, “I bear on my body the marks of Jesus” (Galatians 6:17), and remain “no part of the world” (John 17:16). Their anointing, “You have an anointing from the holy one” (1 John 2:20), equips them for service, “They will judge the world” (1 Corinthians 6:2), ensuring Jehovah’s justice, “The full number of those who are sealed” (Revelation 7:4).</p>
                        <h2>Future Responsibilities</h2>
                        <p>In the Kingdom, the anointed will administer justice, “They sat on thrones, and judgment was given to them” (Revelation 20:4), and guide humanity, “They will be priests” (Revelation 20:6). Their heavenly resurrection, “Raised in the clouds” (1 Thessalonians 4:17), prepares them to serve, “They will rule as kings forever” (Revelation 22:5). True worshipers support them now, “A people for his name” (Acts 15:14), preparing for paradise, “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They will rule as kings over the earth.” —Revelation 5:10</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">The Great Crowd’s Hope</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The great crowd, attending the Memorial, have an earthly hope, “The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29), made possible by Christ’s ransom, “A ransom in exchange for many” (Matthew 20:28). They survive the great tribulation, “They have washed their robes” (Revelation 7:14), to inhabit paradise, “No resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24). Their faith, “The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36), and obedience, “Seek righteousness, seek meekness” (Zephaniah 2:3), mirror Noah’s, “He constructed an ark” (Hebrews 11:7). They attend the Memorial to show gratitude, “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), preparing for “A new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). True worshipers join this hope, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s lies, like heaven for all, obscure this hope, “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s Word clarifies, “The earth remains forever” (Ecclesiastes 1:4). False religion’s rituals, like Easter, rooted in Babylon, are rejected, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). The great crowd’s hope is foreshadowed by Israel’s deliverance, “Jehovah brought them out” (Exodus 12:51), and confirmed by Jesus’ promise, “The tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). True worshipers prepare, “Let us celebrate the festival with sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8).</p>
                        <h2>Requirements for Survival</h2>
                        <p>The great crowd must exercise faith, “We have been declared righteous through faith” (Romans 5:1), and remain loyal, “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). They reject false worship, “You cannot be partaking of the table of Jehovah and the table of demons” (1 Corinthians 10:21), and stay neutral, “My Kingdom is no part of this world” (John 18:36). Their preaching, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), proves devotion, as in the first century, “They were scattered, preaching the word” (Acts 8:4).</p>
                        <h2>Life in Paradise</h2>
                        <p>In paradise, the great crowd will “build houses and live in them” (Isaiah 65:21), enjoying peace, “They will not learn war anymore” (Isaiah 2:4), and health, “The eyes of the blind will be opened” (Isaiah 35:5). The resurrection, “Those in the memorial tombs will come out” (John 5:28-29), reunites families under the anointed’s guidance, “They will be priests” (Revelation 20:6). True worshipers prepare now, “Seek Jehovah while he may be found” (Isaiah 55:6), for “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Rejection of False Rituals</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The Memorial’s simplicity—bread, wine, prayer—rejects false rituals like Easter, rooted in Babylonian fertility rites from 2000 BCE, which blend Christ’s resurrection with paganism, “You cannot be partaking of the table of Jehovah and the table of demons” (1 Corinthians 10:21). Jehovah demands pure worship, “You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth” (John 4:24), as seen when He struck Nadab and Abihu for “unauthorized fire” (Leviticus 10:1-2). The Memorial, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19), honors Christ’s sacrifice, “A propitiatory sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 2:2), without pagan trappings. True worshipers reject false festivals, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and prepare for the Memorial, “Let us celebrate the festival with sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8), upholding Jehovah’s standard, “I am Jehovah; I do not change” (Malachi 3:6).</p>
                        <p>Satan promotes false rituals to obscure Christ’s sacrifice, “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s Word exposes them. Easter’s eggs and rabbits, tied to Babylonian goddess Ishtar, contrast with the Memorial’s purity, “Not with old leaven” (1 Corinthians 5:8). Israel’s idolatry, “They worshiped the Baals” (Judges 2:11), brought punishment, “Jehovah’s anger blazed” (Judges 2:14), a warning for today. True worshipers stand firm, “We must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29), honoring the ransom, “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20).</p>
                        <h2>Historical Pagan Influence</h2>
                        <p>Pagan rituals infiltrated false religion by the third century CE, blending Christian events with festivals like Saturnalia and Ishtar’s rites, “They adopted the customs of the nations” (2 Kings 17:8). The Council of Nicaea in 325 CE formalized Easter, rejecting the Passover’s timing, but Jehovah’s Word preserves truth, “The word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25). Archaeological finds, like Babylonian tablets, confirm these pagan origins, exposing “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5). The Memorial avoids such lies, “A festival to Jehovah” (Exodus 12:14).</p>
                        <h2>Pure Worship Today</h2>
                        <p>True worshipers maintain pure worship, “Be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16), by observing the Memorial correctly, “Examine yourselves” (1 Corinthians 11:28), and preaching truth, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). The first century rejected paganism, “They turned to God from idols” (1 Thessalonians 1:9), and today, millions follow, “No part of the world” (John 17:16). This ensures Jehovah’s blessing, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), and a future where “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>

            <!-- Gratitude for the Ransom -->

                    <summary class="item-button">Gratitude for the Ransom</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Gratitude for Christ’s ransom, “The Son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:28), motivates true worshipers to attend the Memorial, “Keep doing this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19), and live faithfully, “You were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20). The ransom, “A propitiatory sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 2:2), frees humanity from sin’s penalty, “The wages sin pays is death” (Romans 6:23), offering eternal life, “The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36). This reflects Jehovah’s love, “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son” (John 3:16), and justice, “The soul who sins is the one who will die” (Ezekiel 18:4). True worshipers express gratitude by preaching, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and obeying, “The one doing the will of my Father” (Matthew 7:21), preparing for paradise, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Satan’s lies, like salvation through works, diminish the ransom’s value, “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s Word clarifies, “We have been declared righteous through faith” (Romans 5:1). False religion’s rituals obscure gratitude, but the Memorial’s focus on Christ’s sacrifice, “By one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14), inspires devotion. The first century saw thousands respond, “They continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42), and today, millions attend, “Let us celebrate the festival with sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8), honoring “Through him you believe in God” (1 Peter 1:21).</p>
                        <h2>Expressing Gratitude</h2>
                        <p>Gratitude is shown through worship, “Offer to God a sacrifice of praise” (Hebrews 13:15), and moral living, “Be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16). Preaching, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), spreads the ransom’s benefits, as Paul did, “I am clean from the blood of all men” (Acts 20:26). The Memorial calls for reflection, “Examine yourselves” (1 Corinthians 11:28), ensuring sincerity, “Not with old leaven” (1 Corinthians 5:8). This mirrors Israel’s gratitude for deliverance, “A memorial for you” (Exodus 12:14).</p>
                        <h2>Future Blessings</h2>
                        <p>The ransom’s gratitude fuels hope for paradise, “The tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3), where “Death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4). The resurrection, “Those in the memorial tombs will come out” (John 5:28-29), and the anointed’s rule, “They will be priests” (Revelation 20:6), fulfill Jehovah’s purpose, “My purpose will stand” (Isaiah 46:10). True worshipers live for this, “Seek Jehovah while he may be found” (Isaiah 55:6), confident in “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
