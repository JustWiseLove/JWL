            <p class="scripture">“Therefore, since we are receiving a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us continue to have undeserved kindness, through which we may acceptably offer God sacred service with godly fear and awe.” — Hebrews 12:28</p>
            <p class="describe">Jehovah’s promises and His unshakable Kingdom stand firm, anchored by fulfilled prophecies, divine power, and the enduring truth of His Word. Through challenges like persecution, ridicule, and doubt, the faithful are equipped with unwavering strength to endure every trial, confidently preaching “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). This certainty prepares them for a righteous new world, where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), fulfilling Jehovah’s purpose for everlasting life.</p>

            <!-- Enduring Persecution -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Enduring Persecution</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Unshakable faith enables true worshipers to endure persecution, as foretold: “All those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted” (2 Timothy 3:12). Jesus commissioned His followers to “go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19), warning them, “You will be hated by all people on account of my name” (Matthew 10:22). Despite Satan’s attacks, described as “the dragon became enraged with the woman” (Revelation 12:17), Jehovah promises, “Do not be afraid, for I am with you” (Isaiah 41:10), ensuring strength to remain steadfast.</p>
                        <p>In 33 CE, Stephen faced martyrdom, yet “they could not stand up to his wisdom” (Acts 6:10), demonstrating unshakable faith. Like Stephen, faithful ones today heed the call to “get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), separating from false religion. They pray, “Deliver me from my enemies, O Jehovah” (Psalm 59:1), and rely on Scripture, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), trusting Jehovah’s promise: “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their endurance aligns with the hope of “a new heavens and a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where righteousness will prevail.</p>
                        <h2>Strengthening Faith</h2>
                        <p>Faith is fortified through diligent study, as Peter urged, “Pay attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place” (2 Peter 1:19), and through Christian association, “Let us consider one another so as to incite to love and fine works” (Hebrews 10:25). In 537 BCE, Daniel’s unwavering trust, evidenced when “my God sent his angel” (Daniel 6:22) to protect him in the lions’ den, inspires modern worshipers. By immersing themselves in Jehovah’s Word and fellowship, they build the resilience to face persecution, confident that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Trusting Jehovah</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers trust Jehovah’s protection, declaring, “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid” (Hebrews 13:6). Jesus set the perfect example, proclaiming, “I have conquered the world!” (John 16:33), despite facing intense opposition. This trust prepares the faithful for the promised paradise, where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). By remaining loyal under persecution, they demonstrate their devotion to Jehovah’s unshakable Kingdom, ready to inherit its eternal blessings.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” — Revelation 2:10</p>

            <!-- Facing Ridicule -->
            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Facing Ridicule</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Unshakable faith empowers worshipers to withstand ridicule, as forewarned: “They will speak abusively of you because they are bewildered by your good conduct” (1 Peter 4:4). Obeying Jesus’ command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), they face mockery, just as Jesus endured: “Others he saved; himself he cannot save” (Matthew 27:42). Satan, “the god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), stirs scorn to weaken resolve, but Jehovah strengthens, saying, “Do not be afraid of them” (Matthew 10:28). Worshipers boldly declare, “We cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard” (Acts 4:20), preaching “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p>In 455 BCE, Nehemiah faced ridicule from enemies who “kept ridiculing us” (Nehemiah 4:1) while rebuilding Jerusalem’s walls, yet he persevered, trusting Jehovah. Today, faithful ones follow his example, separating from false religion: “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Give your servant strength” (Psalm 86:16), and focus on Scripture, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), assured that “those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their steadfastness prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where righteousness reigns.</p>
                        <h2>Overcoming Mockery</h2>
                        <p>Overcoming ridicule requires boldness, as Paul stated, “I am not ashamed of the good news” (Romans 1:16), and humility, “Do nothing out of contentiousness or egotism” (Philippians 2:3). Around 2370 BCE, Noah, “a preacher of righteousness” (2 Peter 2:5), endured mockery while building the ark, yet his faith prevailed. Modern worshipers draw strength from such examples, maintaining their integrity and confidence that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), even when scorned for their faith.</p>
                        <h2>Maintaining Dignity</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers maintain dignity by responding with kindness, striving to “be peaceable with all men” (Romans 12:18), and emulating Jesus, who “when being insulted, he did not insult in return” (1 Peter 2:23). Their dignified conduct under ridicule reflects their trust in Jehovah’s promise of a future where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). By staying focused on the Kingdom, they rise above mockery, prepared for Jehovah’s eternal blessings.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“We cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.” — Acts 4:20</p>

            <!-- Resisting Family Opposition -->

                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Resisting Family Opposition</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Unshakable faith enables worshipers to resist opposition from family, as Jesus warned: “A man’s enemies will be those of his own household” (Matthew 10:36). Despite such challenges, they fulfill Jesus’ command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). In 33 CE, Jesus faced disbelief from His own brothers, who “were not exercising faith in him” (John 7:5), yet He prioritized God’s will. Satan seeks to divide families, as “the dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah unites His people, promising, “Do not be afraid, for I am with you” (Isaiah 41:10).</p>
                        <p>In the 1st century, Timothy remained faithful despite family challenges, having “from infancy known the holy writings” (2 Timothy 3:15), guided by his mother and grandmother. Today, worshipers prioritize Jehovah, declaring, “Whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother” (Mark 3:35). They separate from false religion, heeding, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and pray, “Create in me a clean heart, O God” (Psalm 51:10), trusting that “those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their loyalty prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Balancing Loyalties</h2>
                        <p>Balancing family ties with devotion to Jehovah requires love, as commanded, “Honor your father and your mother” (Ephesians 6:2), and unwavering obedience to God, “We must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29). In 1711 BCE, Joseph resisted temptation, saying, “How could I commit this great evil and actually sin against God?” (Genesis 39:9), setting an example of loyalty. Worshipers today strive to maintain family respect while prioritizing Jehovah, confident that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Showing Respect</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers show respect to family, ensuring “your speech be always gracious, seasoned with salt” (Colossians 4:6), and follow Jesus’ example, who said, “I have not come to destroy but to fulfill” (Matthew 5:17). Their respectful conduct, even amidst opposition, reflects their faith in Jehovah’s promise of a future where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). By staying loyal to Jehovah, they prepare for the blessings of His unshakable Kingdom.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother.” — Mark 3:35</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Standing Firm in Trials</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Unshakable faith empowers worshipers to stand firm in trials, as Jesus assured: “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). Obeying the command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), they face challenges, just as Jesus “endured a torture stake” (Hebrews 12:2) for God’s will. Satan tests the faithful, as “the god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah strengthens, promising, “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid” (Hebrews 13:6). Worshipers remain loyal, urged to “be faithful even to death” (Revelation 2:10), preaching “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p>Around 1473 BCE, Job endured devastating loss, yet declared, “Jehovah has given, and Jehovah has taken away” (Job 1:21), proving his faith. Today, faithful ones separate from false religion, heeding, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They study, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), and trust Jehovah’s promise: “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their endurance prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where righteousness will flourish.</p>
                        <h2>Building Endurance</h2>
                        <p>Endurance is built through persistent prayer, as urged, “Keep on praying” (1 Thessalonians 5:17), and Christian association, “Not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25). In the 1st century, Paul’s perseverance, declaring, “I have fought the fine fight” (2 Timothy 4:7), inspires worshipers to remain steadfast. By relying on Jehovah’s strength, they overcome trials, confident that “ the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), ready for the blessings of the unshakable Kingdom.</p>
                        <h2>Relying on Jehovah</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers rely on Jehovah, their “strength and fortress” (Psalm 18:2), following Jesus’ example, who prayed, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit” (Luke 23:46). Their trust in Jehovah’s guidance ensures they can face any trial, preparing for the promised paradise where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). By standing firm, they demonstrate their loyalty to Jehovah’s unshakable Kingdom.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one who endures to the end will be saved.” — Matthew 24:13</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Overcoming Doubt</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Unshakable faith overcomes doubt, as affirmed: “This is the victory that has overcome the world, our faith” (1 John 5:4). While fulfilling Jesus’ command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), worshipers face uncertainty, yet Jesus reassured Thomas, “Stop being unbelieving, but become believing” (John 20:27). Satan sows doubt, as “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah’s Word clarifies, “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Worshipers strengthen their trust, urged to “pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), and preach “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p>In 1107 BCE, Gideon overcame doubt when reassured, “Jehovah is with you, you mighty warrior” (Judges 6:12), leading him to victory. Today, faithful ones seek truth, separating from false religion: “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They study diligently, “This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth” (Joshua 1:8), trusting Jehovah’s promise: “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their conviction prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Strengthening Conviction</h2>
                        <p>Conviction grows through meditation, “I will meditate on all your activity” (Psalm 119:15), and prayer, “Open my eyes that I may see” (Psalm 119:18). In 33 CE, Peter’s recovery after denying Jesus, when tasked to “feed my lambs” (John 21:15), inspires worshipers to rebuild faith. By focusing on Jehovah’s promises, they overcome doubt, assured that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), ready for the unshakable Kingdom’s blessings.</p>
                        <h2>Seeking Truth</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers seek truth by studying, “Search for it as for hidden treasures” (Proverbs 2:4), and following Jesus, who declared, “I am the way and the truth and the life” (John 14:6). Their pursuit of truth strengthens their faith, preparing them for the paradise where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). By overcoming doubt, they align with Jehovah’s purpose for His unshakable Kingdom.</p>

                        <p>Unshakable faith empowers worshipers to reject worldly pressure, as urged: “Do not be conformed to this system of things” (Romans 12:2). While obeying Jesus’ command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), they resist temptation, just as Jesus rebuked, “Get behind me, Satan!” (Matthew 16:23). Satan tempts through “the god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah guides, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105). Worshipers stand firm, urged to “flee from youthful desires” (2 Timothy 2:22), and preach “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p>In 607 BCE, Daniel’s companions refused to bow to a golden image, declaring, “We will not serve your gods” (Daniel 3:18), trusting Jehovah’s deliverance. Today, faithful ones separate from false religion, heeding, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Do not let us yield to temptation” (Matthew 6:13), trusting Jehovah’s promise: “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their resistance prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Guarding the Mind</h2>
                        <p>Guarding the mind involves rejecting immorality, “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Corinthians 6:18), and falsehood, “Abhor what is wicked” (Romans 12:9). In 475 BCE, Esther’s courage, declaring, “If I perish, I perish” (Esther 4:16), to save her people, inspires worshipers to stand firm. By focusing on Jehovah’s standards, they maintain integrity, confident that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), ready for the Kingdom’s blessings.</p>
                        <h2>Living for Jehovah</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers live for Jehovah, urged to “seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33), following Jesus’ example, who said, “I do not seek my own will but the will of him who sent me” (John 5:30). Their commitment to Jehovah’s will prepares them for the paradise where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). By rejecting worldly pressure, they demonstrate loyalty to Jehovah’s unshakable Kingdom.</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Unshakable faith enables worshipers to maintain joy amid opposition, as urged: “Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials” (James 1:2). While obeying Jesus’ command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), they face challenges, yet find joy, as Paul and Silas did in 50 CE, “praying and praising God with song” (Acts 16:25) in prison. Satan seeks to discourage, as “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah uplifts, declaring, “The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold” (Nehemiah 8:10).</p>
                        <p>In 607 BCE, Habakkuk rejoiced despite hardship, proclaiming, “I will exult in Jehovah” (Habakkuk 3:18), trusting God’s salvation. Today, faithful ones find joy in separating from false religion, heeding, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Let my heart rejoice in your salvation” (Psalm 13:5), and trust Jehovah’s promise: “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Their joy prepares them for “a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where righteousness prevails.</p>
                        <h2>Finding Joy</h2>
                        <p>Joy springs from faith, as “a joyful heart is good medicine” (Proverbs 17:22), and Christian association, “Encourage one another” (Hebrews 10:25). In 33 CE, the disciples “returned with great joy” (Luke 10:17) after preaching, inspiring worshipers to find happiness in service. By focusing on Jehovah’s promises, they maintain joy, confident that “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), ready for the unshakable Kingdom.</p>
                        <h2>Sharing Joy</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers share joy by preaching, “Proclaiming the good news” (Acts 8:4), and encouraging others, “Speak consolingly to the depressed souls” (1 Thessalonians 5:14). Jesus prayed, “That my joy may be made full in them” (John 15:11), guiding worshipers to uplift others. Their joyful service prepares them for the paradise where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), fulfilling Jehovah’s purpose for His unshakable Kingdom.</p>

                        <p>Unshakable faith proves loyal under test, as Jesus promised: “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). While fulfilling the command to “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), worshipers face trials, yet remain steadfast, as Peter did in 33 CE, declaring, “You are the Christ” (Matthew 16:16), despite pressure. Satan tests loyalty, as “the dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah rewards, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30).</p>
                        <p>In 1918 BCE, Abraham proved his faith, as “by faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac” (Hebrews 11:17), trusting Jehovah’s promise. Today, faithful ones demonstrate loyalty, separating from false religion: “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4).

                        <h2>Proving Loyalty</h2>
                        <p>Loyalty requires obedience, as declared, “We must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29), and trust, “Jehovah is my helper” (Hebrews 13:6). In 537 BCE, Daniel’s faith, shown by “he kept praying three times a day” (Daniel 6:10) despite a ban, inspires worshipers to remain loyal. By prioritizing Jehovah’s will, they ensure “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), ready for the unshakable Kingdom’s blessings.</p>
                        <h2>Enduring Tests</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers endure tests by following Jesus’ example, who prayed, “Father, if you wish, remove this cup from me” (Luke 22:42), yet submitted to God’s will. They study, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), strengthening their resolve. Their faithfulness under test prepares them for the paradise where “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13), fulfilling Jehovah’s purpose for His unshakable Kingdom.</p>
