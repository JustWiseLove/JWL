                        <h2>(c. 1513 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>The Bible’s canon began around 1513 BCE with the Hebrew Scriptures, when Moses, guided by Jehovah’s spirit, wrote the first five books—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This date is inferred from biblical chronology and paleographic analysis of inscriptions like the Gezer Calendar (10th century BCE). Jehovah Himself initiated this sacred work, inscribing the Ten Commandments on stone tablets (Exodus 31:18) and commanding Moses to record His laws (Exodus 34:27). These writings, forming the Pentateuch, established Israel’s covenant with Jehovah, reflecting divine inspiration through their harmony and fulfilled prophecy, such as the 70-year exile foretold in Jeremiah 29:10, which history confirms ended in 537 BCE with Cyrus’ decree (Ezra 1:1-4).</p>
                        <p>Their authenticity is evident in their focus on Jehovah’s worship, free from uninspired additions, and their preservation beside the ark (Deuteronomy 31:26). Archaeological finds like the Silver Scrolls (carbon-14 dated to 600 BCE) with “YHWH” blessings affirm their early use. Unlike other ancient texts, such as the Egyptian Book of the Dead, which mixes superstition with mythology, the Pentateuch’s historical accuracy and prophetic reliability set it apart, fulfilling “the saying of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The saying of Jehovah endures forever.” — 1 Peter 1:25</p>

                        <h2>(c. 5th Century BCE)</h2>
                        <p>By the end of the fifth century BCE, the Hebrew canon was finalized at 39 books (or 24 in Jewish tradition), a process guided by divine inspiration through scribes like Ezra, a skilled priest (Ezra 7:6), and Nehemiah. This timeline is supported by historical records and textual analysis of the Septuagint (280 BCE). Books from Joshua to Malachi, written by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, were recognized for turning people to Jehovah’s worship, showing harmony with His purpose, and fulfilling prophecy, such as Isaiah 44:28 naming Cyrus 150 years before his birth, verified by the Cyrus Cylinder (circa 539 BCE).</p>
                        <p>Jesus and the apostles exclusively quoted these books (e.g., Matthew 11:10 citing Malachi), and no post-Malachi writings (circa 443 BCE) were included, confirming the canon’s closure without human councils. The Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE) match later Masoretic texts, proving textual fidelity. Unlike the Apocrypha, which lacks prophetic power and contains errors (e.g., Judith’s historical inaccuracies), the Hebrew canon’s divine criteria ensure “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16) for salvation.</p>

                        <h2>(c. 41–98 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Christian Greek Scriptures, adding 27 books, were written between 41 and 98 CE by apostles and disciples like Paul, John, and Luke, under holy spirit’s guidance. This timeline is based on historical evidence, such as Paul’s imprisonment (Acts 28:30, circa 61 CE), and paleographic dating of early manuscripts like the Rylands Papyrus P52 (circa 125 CE). These writings, including the Gospels and epistles, built on the Hebrew Scriptures, detailing Jesus’ life and Jehovah’s Kingdom, with fulfilled prophecies like Micah 5:2 predicting Bethlehem as Jesus’ birthplace (Matthew 2:6).</p>
                        <p>First-century Christians, gifted with “discernment of inspired expressions” (1 Corinthians 12:10), accepted these books, rejecting uninspired works like the Gospel of Thomas, which lacks apostolic authority and promotes Gnostic contradictions. The unity of these writings, despite authors’ diverse backgrounds—from fishermen (Peter) to physicians (Luke)—underscores their divine origin, fulfilling “the word of God is alive” (Hebrews 4:12) with a trustworthy message.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The word of God is alive.” — Hebrews 4:12</p>

                        <h2>(c. 2nd Century CE)</h2>
                        <p>By the late second century CE, the Christian Greek Scriptures’ canon was finalized, totaling 66 books, as seen in early catalogs like the Muratorian Fragment (circa 170 CE) and over 5,200 Greek manuscripts. This closure followed John’s death around 98 CE, after which no new inspired writings emerged. Each book met divine criteria: turning to Jehovah’s worship, avoiding superstition, and harmonizing with the whole, as “men spoke from God” (2 Peter 1:21). For example, Revelation’s prophecy of “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5) aligns with earlier scriptures on false religion.</p>
                        <p>Jesus’ and the apostles’ use of both testaments (e.g., Acts 15:15-18 citing Amos) confirms a consistent catalog. Early codices like Codex Sinaiticus (paleography dated 325–350 CE) preserve this canon, excluding apocryphal works like the Book of Enoch, which contradicts scripture with mythical elements. This divine selection ensures “we have the prophetic word made more sure” (2 Peter 1:19) in its entirety.</p>

                        <h2>(Throughout Biblical Era)</h2>
                        <p>The Bible’s trustworthiness is reinforced by its writers’ rare honesty in admitting their failures, a trait absent in most ancient texts. Moses recorded his killing of an Egyptian (Exodus 2:12), yet Jehovah used him to lead Israel. David confessed his adultery with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah (2 Samuel 11:14-17), yet his repentance shines in Psalm 51. Peter admitted denying Jesus three times (Matthew 26:75), yet his growth is evident in 1 Peter 1:3. This transparency, spanning centuries, reflects holy spirit’s guidance, as “men spoke from God” (2 Peter 1:21).</p>
                        <p>Unlike other religious works, such as the Quran, which idealizes its figures (e.g., Muhammad’s portrayal in Surah 33:21), the Bible’s candor about human flaws demonstrates authenticity. The Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE) and early codices preserve these accounts, showing consistency. This honesty builds trust, fulfilling “the word of God is alive” (Hebrews 4:12) as a truthful record.</p>

                        <p>The Bible’s 40 authors, writing over 1,600 years, spanned diverse lands and cultures yet delivered a unified message, proving its divine origin. Moses wrote in Egypt’s wilderness, David in Israel’s palaces, Jeremiah in Judah’s courts, Paul traveled from Jerusalem to Rome, and John recorded from Patmos. They included shepherds (Amos), kings (Solomon), fishermen (Peter), and a physician (Luke), using Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, from 1513 BCE to 98 CE, as dated by biblical chronology and manuscripts like Papyrus P46 (circa 200 CE).</p>
                        <p>Unlike fragmented texts like the Vedas, compiled over centuries with conflicting teachings, the Bible’s consistency—seen in prophecies like Daniel 9:24-27 predicting Jesus’ arrival—reflects holy spirit’s guidance, as “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16). The Dead Sea Scrolls and early codices (paleography dated 325–350 CE) confirm this unity across regions like Mesopotamia, Canaan, and Asia Minor, fulfilling “we have the prophetic word made more sure” (2 Peter 1:19).</p>

                        <p>The Bible’s authenticity stands out against other religious writings through its superior evidence and divine criteria. Unlike the Book of Mormon, which lacks archaeological support (e.g., no evidence for its cities like Zarahemla), the Bible’s historical accuracy is verified by artifacts like the Tel Dan Stele (circa 840 BCE) mentioning the “House of David.” The Bible’s 66 books show prophetic fulfillment—e.g., Isaiah 44:28 naming Cyrus, confirmed by the Cyrus Cylinder (539 BCE)—while texts like the Quran lack predictive prophecy, relying on later traditions (Hadith) without manuscript support until centuries later.</p>
                        <p>The Bible’s manuscript evidence, with over 24,000 copies (e.g., Codex Vaticanus, dated 325 CE via paleography), far exceeds the 1,500 for the Iliad or the few dozen for the Vedas. Its internal harmony, despite diverse authors, contrasts with the contradictions in apocryphal works like the Gospel of Thomas, which promotes Gnosticism incompatible with scripture. This distinction, rooted in Jehovah’s guidance, ensures “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8) as the true Word.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The word of our God endures forever.” — Isaiah 40:8</p>

                        <p>The Bible’s trustworthiness is proven by its global spread and meticulous preservation since the first century CE. Early Christians copied and shared the Greek Scriptures, as seen in the Rylands Papyrus P52 (dated 125 CE via paleography) found in Egypt. By the 4th century, codices like Sinaiticus (dated 325–350 CE via paleography) reached the Roman Empire, and the Latin Vulgate spread across Europe by the Middle Ages. Today, the Bible exists in over 3,000 languages, with 240 million New World Translation copies distributed globally, supported by over 24,000 manuscripts, far surpassing other ancient works like the Iliad’s 1,500 copies.</p>
                        <p>Despite persecution, Jehovah preserved His Word, as seen in the Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE) matching modern texts. Artifacts like the Moabite Stone (840 BCE) confirm its historical accuracy, unlike the Book of Mormon’s lack of evidence. This enduring reach and preservation fulfill “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10), proving the Bible’s authenticity as God’s complete Word.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You are my witnesses,” says Jehovah. — Isaiah 43:10</p>
