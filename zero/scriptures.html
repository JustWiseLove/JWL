                <p>This verse reveals Jehovah’s sovereign authority to define right and wrong. Spoken to Adam in Eden, it establishes obedience as the foundation of life. Eating the forbidden fruit brought death, not eternal torment, proving the soul is mortal and refuting Satan’s lie of immortality.

To gain everlasting life, reject worldly rebellion and live by Jehovah’s standards, avoiding immorality and falsehoods. Proclaim this truth boldly, warning others of disobedience’s penalty. Study Jehovah’s Word to discern His will, and choose righteousness over temptation. Hesitation aligns with Satan’s deception, leading to destruction.

This truth exposes Satan’s fleeting rule and Jehovah’s unstoppable purpose for a paradise earth. Dedicate yourself to proclaiming this victory, resisting temptations like materialism. Study Jehovah’s Word to strengthen faith, and share this hope to awaken others. Choosing Jehovah’s side ensures everlasting life under His Kingdom, where evil will vanish.

In Abraham’s plea for Sodom, Jehovah reveals His willingness to spare the wicked for the sake of a few righteous ones, showing His patience and desire for repentance.

                <p class="scripture">“And the spirit and the bride say, ‘Come!’ And let anyone hearing say, ‘Come!’ And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone who wishes take life’s water free.”</p>
                <p>This verse reveals Jehovah’s open invitation to life. Written by John around 96 CE, it depicts the spirit and bride inviting all to take life’s water freely, symbolizing salvation. This means Jehovah offers eternal life to all who thirst for truth. To gain everlasting life, accept this invitation, rejecting apathy. Proclaim this call, inviting others to drink. Study Jehovah’s Word to quench spiritual thirst, and live faithfully, sharing life’s water. This truth refutes the lie that salvation is restricted, demanding response. Ignoring the call aligns with Satan, leading to destruction. Choose life’s water now, and secure eternal life in paradise.</p>
