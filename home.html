                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>To accept Bible truth, your personality matters. Some resist because they’ve been indoctrinated with lies for years. Jehovah seeks those with the right traits to break free and learn. What are they?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Are you hungry for truth?</strong> A deep desire to know Jehovah drives you to seek His Word over human traditions.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, since they will be filled. — Matthew 5:6</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Are you honest with yourself?</strong> Facing the truth means admitting you might have been misled—hard, but vital for growth.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>The one speaking truth declares what is right, but a false witness speaks deceit. — Proverbs 12:17</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Are you humble enough to change?</strong> Pride blocks learning; humility opens your heart to Jehovah’s correction.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones. — James 4:6</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Are you open-minded to new ideas?</strong> Overcoming indoctrination requires examining the Bible without prejudice.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>They accepted the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily. — Acts 17:11</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Do you have courage to stand apart?</strong> Truth often means rejecting popular lies—courage keeps you firm.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>Be courageous and strong… for Jehovah your God is with you. — Joshua 1:9</em></p>
                            </div>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These traits—hunger, honesty, humility, open-mindedness, and courage—equip you to see past a lifetime of lies and embrace Jehovah’s truth!</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Is The Bible Trustworthy?</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>The Bible stands as Jehovah’s unshakable truth—written by honest men, proven by history and science, and enduring all attacks. Why trust it?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Men Moved by God:</strong> Over 40 writers across 1,600 years—fishermen, kings, prophets—wrote as one under Jehovah’s spirit (2 Peter 1:21), baring their flaws (Exodus 4:10, Psalm 51).</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial… — 2 Timothy 3:16</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Science Confirms It:</strong> The earth hangs “upon nothing” (Job 26:7), is a “circle” (Isaiah 40:22), and blood is life (Leviticus 17:11)—facts ahead of human discovery.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>Your word is truth. — John 17:17</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>History Proves It:</strong> Sennacherib’s Prism (2 Kings 18-19), the Pilate Stone (John 19:13), and the Dead Sea Scrolls (Isaiah 40:8) affirm its accuracy.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>The word of our God endures forever. — Isaiah 40:8</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>The Only Lasting Path:</strong> Wealth and fame fail (Ecclesiastes 5:10), but knowing Jehovah brings life (John 17:3) through study and prayer.</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you… — John 17:3</em></p>
                            </div>
                            <li><strong>Unshaken by Time:</strong> Burned, banned, yet thriving in 3,000+ languages, its purity holds (Psalm 12:6; Isaiah 55:11).</li>
                            <div class="scripture">
                                <p><em>The word of Jehovah endures forever. — 1 Peter 1:25</em></p>
                            </div>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Word outlasts all—trust it over human lies!</p>
