                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>The Bible identifies Satan as “the ruler of this world” who blinds people to the truth. He uses lies and distractions—wealth, power, and selfish desires—to trap humanity in a system opposed to Jehovah. This world’s ways promise happiness but deliver emptiness, as people chase fleeting pleasures instead of lasting peace. Satan’s influence began when he deceived Eve, and it continues today through pride and rebellion against God’s standards.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” —1 John 5:19</p>

                        <p>In contrast, Jehovah offers wisdom that leads to life. His Word teaches us to reject selfish ambition and pursue righteousness, humility, and love. Through the Bible, Jehovah reveals how to see through Satan’s schemes and find true purpose. This wisdom isn’t human—it’s divine, given to those who seek Jehovah with a sincere heart, trusting His guidance over the world’s noise.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.” —Proverbs 9:10</p>

                        <p>Satan’s world is built on sand—greed, violence, and immorality. The Bible warns that it’s temporary, soon to be replaced by Jehovah’s Kingdom. People may gain riches or fame, but these fade, leaving them unsatisfied. Satan tempts with instant gratification, but Jehovah promises something better: a future where “the meek will possess the earth” and live forever in peace.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The world is passing away and so is its desire, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.” —1 John 2:17</p>

                        <p>Jehovah’s wisdom offers more than survival—it offers life without end. By studying His Word and applying it, we gain strength to resist Satan’s lures. Jesus showed this when he rejected Satan’s temptations, relying on Jehovah’s truth. We can too, choosing obedience over compromise, and finding joy in serving the God who never lies or fails.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</p>

                        <p>Every day, we face a choice: follow Satan’s dying world or embrace Jehovah’s living wisdom. The Bible urges us to “keep on seeking first the Kingdom” and trust Jehovah’s promises over Satan’s illusions. History shows this world’s failures—wars, injustice, sorrow—but Jehovah’s wisdom points to a new world, soon to come, where His will prevails.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Happy is the man who finds wisdom and the man who acquires discernment; it is more precious than corals, and nothing else you desire can compare to it.” —Proverbs 3:13, 15</p>

        <!-- Featured Section 2: Explore Truth vs. False Worship -->

                    <summary class="card-header">Explore Truth vs. False Worship</summary>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>Worshiping Jehovah in truth is essential for everlasting life. The Bible warns that false worship, even with good intentions, leads to ruin, as seen with the Israelites and echoed in today’s practices.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must not have any other gods besides me.” —Exodus 20:3</p>

                        <p>The Israelites turned to pagan gods, like the golden calf, claiming it honored Jehovah (Exodus 32:4-6). God judged it idolatry, and thousands perished (Exodus 32:28). They later served Baal, offering children in fire (Jeremiah 19:5), a practice so vile that many died in the wilderness, never reaching the Promised Land (Numbers 14:29-30). Their error was blending pagan traditions with worship, defying Jehovah’s command.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They went mixing with the nations and learned their works.” —Psalm 106:35</p>

                        <p>Today, false worship thrives in traditions masquerading as faith. Christmas, tied to December 25, stems from Saturnalia, a Roman festival honoring the sun god Saturn, with trees and gift-giving rooted in pagan rituals—not Jesus’ birth, which the Bible doesn’t date. Easter mixes resurrection with fertility rites, like eggs and rabbits, linked to the goddess Eostre, not Scripture. The Trinity, a cornerstone for many, isn’t biblical—John 17:3 calls Jehovah “the only true God,” distinct from Jesus, yet it mirrors pagan triads from Babylon and Egypt. Birthdays, celebrated universally, originate in spiritism and astrology, with candles and wishes tied to ancient magic, not God’s approval.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Get out from among them, and separate yourselves... and quit touching the unclean thing.” —2 Corinthians 6:17</p>

                        <p>Going to church isn’t enough if we cling to these falsehoods. The Israelites believed in God yet fell; today, many profess faith but follow pagan-rooted customs, risking paradise. True worship requires rejecting these and seeking Jehovah’s truth in the Bible. Joshua and Caleb obeyed and entered Canaan (Joshua 14:6-9), showing that following Jehovah’s standards leads to life.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</p>

                        <p>Exploring truth means abandoning false worship for Jehovah’s way. The Bible promises a paradise where “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11), but only for those who worship “in spirit and truth” (John 4:23-24). Choosing truth over tradition secures a future where Jehovah’s will reigns (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.” —Isaiah 11:9</p>
