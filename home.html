            <div class="scripture">
                <p><em>“Now if it seems bad to you to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve… But as for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah.” (Joshua 24:15)</em></p>

            <div class="item-content">
               <p>Your life’s most vital decision looms: will you serve Satan’s fleeting world or embrace Jehovah’s everlasting Kingdom? Joshua’s challenge rings true today: “Choose for yourselves today whom you will serve… But as for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah” (Joshua 24:15). Temporary relief or permanent solution? Only Jehovah’s truth leads to life. Why choose His Kingdom?</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Satan’s World: Lies and Deception:</strong><br>This world’s systems—politics, religion, commerce—promise freedom but breed chaos, greed, and despair (1 John 5:19). False teachings, like the immortal soul or eternal torment, rooted in human tradition, contradict the Bible’s truth that the dead are unconscious (Ecclesiastes 9:5).</li>
                <div class="scripture">
                <p><em>The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one. — 1 John 5:19</em></p>
                </div>
                <li><strong>Jehovah’s Kingdom: Truth and Honesty:</strong><br>Jehovah’s Word cuts through deception, revealing His Kingdom as a real government that will crush human rule and bring peace (Daniel 2:44). Unlike shifting human promises, Jehovah’s word is unbreakable; He cannot lie (Numbers 23:19).</li>
                <div class="scripture">
                <p><em>God is not a man that he should lie… — Numbers 23:19</em></p>
                </div>
                <li><strong>Temporary Relief vs. Permanent Solution:</strong><br>Satan’s world tempts with short-lived pleasures—wealth, status, indulgence—but they vanish (1 John 2:17). Jehovah’s Kingdom will transform earth into a paradise, erasing pain, sickness, and death forever (Revelation 21:4). Why chase shadows when Jehovah offers eternity?</li>
                <div class="scripture">
                <p><em>God will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more… — Revelation 21:4</em></p>
                </div>
                <li><strong>Moral Standards That Endure:</strong><br>Satan’s world glorifies selfishness, immorality, and violence, degrading humanity (2 Timothy 3:1-5). Jehovah’s standards—love, integrity, purity—uplift lives and build lasting joy (Colossians 3:12-14). Living His way brings purpose now and prepares you for life without end.</li>
                <div class="scripture">
                <p><em>Put on the new personality that was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty. — Ephesians 4:24</em></p>
                </div>
                <li><strong>Your Choice Shapes Your Future:</strong><br>There’s no middle ground; indecision aligns with Satan’s world (Matthew 12:30). Choosing Jehovah means rejecting false teachings, studying His Word, and living His truth (John 4:23). This decision unlocks the path to everlasting life.</li>
                <div class="scripture">
                <p><em>This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God… — John 17:3</em></p>
                </div>
                </ul>
                <p>Satan’s world is doomed to collapse; Jehovah’s Kingdom stands forever. Make the choice that secures your future—serve Jehovah and inherit life eternal!</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                <p><em>The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. — Psalm 37:11</em></p>
