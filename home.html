            <summary>Origins of False Worship</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Ancient Rebellion</h2>
                <p>False worship began with rebellion against Jehovah. After the Flood, Nimrod, a mighty hunter “in opposition to Jehovah,” built Babel to defy God’s command to spread out (Genesis 10:9-10). His tower symbolized human pride, leading to false religion that spread worldwide.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “He was a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah. That is why there is a saying: ‘Just like Nimrod, a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah.’” <cite>—Genesis 10:9</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Pagan Gods Emerge</h2>
                <p>From Babel, false worship spawned pagan gods. Babylonians revered Marduk, a war god, with temples and sacrifices, rejecting Jehovah’s sovereignty. This idolatry infected nations, as people crafted gods from wood and stone, blind to the Creator.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands.” <cite>—Psalm 115:4</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Mixing Truth with Lies</h2>
                <p>Israel fell into false worship by blending Jehovah’s law with pagan rites. King Solomon built altars for Molech, a god demanding child sacrifice (1 Kings 11:7). This compromise angered Jehovah, showing how false religion corrupts even the faithful.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the detestable god of Moab, ... and for Molech, the detestable god of the sons of Ammon.” <cite>—1 Kings 11:7</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A Legacy of Confusion</h2>
                <p>False worship’s roots spread confusion. Egypt’s Osiris and Isis myths inspired trinities across cultures, later influencing apostate Christianity. These lies buried Jehovah’s truth, making it hard for sincere ones to find him amidst the clutter of false gods.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “For they have turned their back to me and not their face.” <cite>—Jeremiah 2:27</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Judgment on Falsehood</h2>
                <p>Jehovah condemned false worship. He destroyed Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. because its people chased idols (2 Chronicles 36:17-19). History proves false religion leads to ruin, urging us to seek the one true God instead.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “There was no one to stop them, so they kept striking them down.” <cite>—2 Chronicles 36:17</cite>

            <summary>False Worship Today</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Pagan Festivals Persist</h2>
                <p>Modern false religion keeps pagan roots alive. Halloween, tied to Samhain, honors spirits with costumes and offerings—practices Jehovah hates (Deuteronomy 18:10-11). Billions join in, unaware they’re echoing ancient falsehoods.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “There should not be found in you anyone who ... consults a spirit medium or a fortune-teller.” <cite>—Deuteronomy 18:10-11</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Materialism as Worship</h2>
                <p>Today, many worship wealth over Jehovah. Megachurches preach prosperity gospels, promising riches for faith, twisting Jesus’ words about seeking God’s Kingdom first (Matthew 6:33). This materialism mimics ancient greed-driven cults.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You cannot slave for God and for Riches.” <cite>—Matthew 6:24</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Interfaith Deception</h2>
                <p>False religion promotes unity over truth. Interfaith movements claim all paths lead to God, defying Jehovah’s exclusive worship (Exodus 20:5). This dilutes his standards, luring people into a vague, unbiblical faith.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “I, Jehovah, am your God. ... You must not have any other gods besides me.” <cite>—Exodus 20:2-3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Moral Compromise</h2>
                <p>Many churches bless what Jehovah condemns—like immorality or war—calling it love. The Bible warns against “friendship with the world” (James 4:4), yet false religion adapts to please people, not God.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?” <cite>—James 4:4</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A Coming End</h2>
                <p>False religion faces destruction. Revelation 17:16 says nations will turn on “Babylon the Great,” the world empire of false religion. Its modern forms can’t escape Jehovah’s judgment—only truth endures.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The ten horns that you saw, and the wild beast, these will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked.” <cite>—Revelation 17:16</cite>

            <summary>Fleeing False Worship</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Hear the Call</h2>
                <p>Jehovah commands us to flee false worship. Revelation 18:4 says, “Get out of her, my people,” urging escape from Babylon the Great’s lies. Staying means sharing her sins—freedom starts with heeding this call.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins.” <cite>—Revelation 18:4</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Test Your Faith</h2>
                <p>Examine your beliefs against the Bible. 1 John 4:1 warns, “Test the inspired statements” to spot falsehoods. If your worship includes unbiblical doctrines—like hellfire or immortal souls—it’s time to question and leave.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Do not believe every inspired statement, but test the inspired statements to see whether they originate with God.” <cite>—1 John 4:1</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Reject Traditions</h2>
                <p>Break free from man-made rituals. Jesus condemned traditions that void God’s Word (Mark 7:13). Ditch pagan holidays and creeds—Jehovah accepts only worship based on his truth, not human inventions.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You make the word of God invalid by your tradition that you have handed down.” <cite>—Mark 7:13</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Seek Jehovah’s People</h2>
                <p>Join those who worship in truth. Zechariah 8:23 promises that people will seek Jehovah’s servants. Find the global brotherhood living by the Bible—together, you’ll stand firm against false religion’s pull.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying: ‘We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’” <cite>—Zechariah 8:23</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A Reward Awaits</h2>
                <p>Escaping false religion secures Jehovah’s favor. Psalm 37:29 says the righteous “will live forever” on earth. Leave the lies behind—truth leads to paradise, where false worship is gone forever.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” <cite>—Psalm 37:29</cite>

            <summary>Searching For Truth</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Your Word Is Truth</h2>
                <p>In a world filled with lies and confusion, can we really find truth? Yes, we can—because Jehovah, the God of truth, has given us his Word, the Bible. Jesus prayed to his Father, saying, “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). The Bible is not a collection of human opinions; it is Jehovah’s inspired message, reliable and factual.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.” <cite>—John 17:17</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Jesus Shows the Way</h2>
                <p>Jesus Christ, Jehovah’s Son, lived and spoke the truth. He boldly declared, “I am the way and the truth and the life” (John 14:6). His life showed us how to please Jehovah, and his teachings guide us to everlasting life through accurate knowledge.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Jesus said to him: ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’” <cite>—John 14:6</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Seek With Spirit</h2>
                <p>Jehovah deserves worship based on truth. Jesus explained, “The true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth” (John 4:23). This means searching the Scriptures with an open heart, rejecting falsehoods to honor Jehovah alone.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for indeed, the Father is looking for ones like these to worship him.” <cite>—John 4:23</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Freedom Through Truth</h2>
                <p>Finding truth takes effort but sets us free. Jesus promised, “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). The Bible answers life’s big questions—like why suffering exists—when we seek diligently.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” <cite>—John 8:32</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A Lighted Path</h2>
                <p>Truth lights the way to Jehovah. The Bible says, “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway” (Psalm 119:105). Start searching now—it’s the first step to a life aligned with God’s purpose.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.” <cite>—Psalm 119:105</cite>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Truth in Action</h2>
                <p>Finding truth is just the start—we must live it. The Bible says, “The one who does the truth comes to the light” (John 3:21). Our actions—how we treat others and work—must reflect Jehovah’s standards.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “But the one who does the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be made evident as having been done in harmony with God.” <cite>—John 3:21</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Integrity Counts</h2>
                <p>Living truth demands integrity. Psalm 26:1 says, “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in my integrity.” Refusing to lie or cheat, even when it’s tough, shows loyalty to Jehovah’s principles.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in my integrity; in Jehovah I have trusted without wavering.” <cite>—Psalm 26:1</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Speaking Honestly</h2>
                <p>Our words must reflect truth. Ephesians 4:25 urges us to “speak truth with his neighbor.” Avoiding gossip or deceit honors Jehovah and builds trust with others.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Therefore, now that you have put away deceit, each one of you speak truth with his neighbor.” <cite>—Ephesians 4:25</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Enduring Trials</h2>
                <p>Living truth can bring challenges. Jesus warned, “In the world you will have tribulation” (John 16:33). Holding to Jehovah’s truth gives us courage, knowing he sustains us.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “In the world you will have tribulation, but take courage! I have conquered the world.” <cite>—John 16:33</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Purposeful Living</h2>
                <p>Truth gives life meaning. Colossians 1:10 encourages us to “go on walking worthily of Jehovah.” Every step in truth—family, work, worship—brings joy and aligns us with his will.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “So that you may go on walking worthily of Jehovah in order to please him fully.” <cite>—Colossians 1:10</cite>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>A Priceless Treasure</h2>
                <p>Proverbs 23:23 urges us to "buy truth and never sell it." Jehovah’s truth is worth more than gold—a command to seek what lasts, found only in God’s Word, not human ideas.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Buy truth and do not sell it—wisdom and discipline and understanding.” <cite>—Proverbs 23:23</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>God’s Word Endures</h2>
                <p>Jehovah is the source of truth. Jesus said, “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Unlike fleeting lies, Jehovah’s truth lasts forever, worth every effort to uncover.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.” <cite>—John 17:17</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Seek Diligently</h2>
                <p>Truth requires effort. Proverbs 2:4-5 says to seek it “as for hidden treasures.” Studying the Bible reveals Jehovah’s purpose—a paradise earth—beyond worthless distractions.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “If you search for it as for silver, ... then you will find the knowledge of God.” <cite>—Proverbs 2:4-5</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Hold It Tight</h2>
                <p>Once found, don’t trade truth for anything. Jesus warned, “What will a man give in exchange for his life?” (Matthew 16:26). It’s your lifeline to Jehovah’s promises.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “What will it benefit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own life?” <cite>—Matthew 16:26</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Everlasting Reward</h2>
                <p>Truth leads to life. Jesus said, “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you” (John 17:3). Value it—study, pray, act—it’s a treasure that never fails.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God.” <cite>—John 17:3</cite>

                <p>Worshiping Jehovah in truth is vital for life. The Bible warns that false worship, even if sincere, leads to ruin, as seen with Israel and reflected today.</p>

                <p>The Israelites mixed Jehovah’s worship with pagan gods like Baal, offering children in fire (Jeremiah 19:5). Many died, never reaching the Promised Land (Numbers 14:29-30).</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “They went mixing with the nations and learned their works.” <cite>—Psalm 106:35</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Pagan Traditions</h2>
                <p>Today, false worship persists in Christmas (Saturnalia) and Easter (fertility rites), not Scripture. The Trinity echoes pagan triads, not Jehovah’s sole divinity.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Get out from among them, and separate yourselves.” <cite>—2 Corinthians 6:17</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Faithful Obedience</h2>
                <p>Church isn’t enough if it’s false. Joshua and Caleb obeyed Jehovah and entered Canaan (Joshua 14:6-9), proving true worship—pure and biblical—leads to life.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God.” <cite>—John 17:3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A True Future</h2>
                <p>True worship chooses Jehovah’s way. The Bible promises a paradise where “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11), reserved for those who reject falsehood.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.” <cite>—Isaiah 11:9</cite>

                <h2>Satan’s Dominion</h2>
                <p>Satan rules this world, blinding people with lies. He uses wealth and power to trap humanity in a system opposed to Jehovah, doomed to fade.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” <cite>—1 John 5:19</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Fleeting Pleasures</h2>
                <p>This world promises joy but delivers emptiness. Satan’s deception, begun with Eve, drives rebellion and pride, offering nothing lasting.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The world is passing away and so is its desire.” <cite>—1 John 2:17</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Jehovah’s Guidance</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s wisdom counters Satan’s lies. His Word teaches righteousness and humility, revealing a purpose beyond this temporary chaos.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.” <cite>—Proverbs 9:10</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Resisting Deception</h2>
                <p>Studying Jehovah’s Word builds strength to resist. Jesus rejected Satan’s temptations (Matthew 4:10), showing how truth overcomes fleeting lures.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you.” <cite>—John 17:3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A Fading System</h2>
                <p>Satan’s world won’t last—Jehovah’s will prevails. The Bible urges us to seek the Kingdom first (Matthew 6:33), not this dying order.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Happy is the man who finds wisdom; it is more precious than corals.” <cite>—Proverbs 3:13, 15</cite>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>God’s Perfect Rule</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom is the solution to this world’s woes. Jesus taught us to pray for it: “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10). It’s God’s government, bringing peace and justice forever.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth.” <cite>—Matthew 6:10</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>End of Suffering</h2>
                <p>The Kingdom will end suffering and death. Revelation 21:4 promises Jehovah will “wipe out every tear,” restoring earth to paradise as he intended.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “He will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more.” <cite>—Revelation 21:4</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A Righteous Earth</h2>
                <p>Under Jehovah’s rule, the meek will thrive. Psalm 37:11 says they “will possess the earth,” living in harmony with God’s perfect standards.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in peace.” <cite>—Psalm 37:11</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Christ as King</h2>
                <p>Jesus, appointed by Jehovah, will rule as King. Daniel 7:14 says his dominion “will not pass away,” ensuring everlasting righteousness.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “To him there were given rulership, ... and his kingdom will not be destroyed.” <cite>—Daniel 7:14</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Your Hope</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom offers eternal life to those who choose truth. John 17:3 ties it to knowing Jehovah—your hope rests in this promise.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God.” <cite>—John 17:3</cite>

            <summary>What Will You Choose?</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>No Middle Ground</h2>
                <p>The Bible demands a choice: Jehovah’s truth or Satan’s lies. Indecision favors Satan, the “father of the lie” (John 8:44)—there’s no neutral stance.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Because you are lukewarm, ... I am going to vomit you out of my mouth.” <cite>—Revelation 3:16</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Israel’s Lesson</h2>
                <p>Israel tried both Jehovah and Baal (2 Kings 17:16-17), ending in exile (2 Kings 17:23). Half-hearted faith fails—Satan claims the uncommitted.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “They exchanged the truth of God for the lie.” <cite>—Romans 1:25</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Today’s Challenge</h2>
                <p>Many mix truth with lies—praying to Jehovah yet keeping pagan rites like Christmas. This gives Satan a foothold, pulling you from Jehovah.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “No one can slave for two masters; ... he will hate the one and love the other.” <cite>—Matthew 6:24</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Stand for Truth</h2>
                <p>Choose fully—Jesus rejected Satan’s offers (Matthew 4:10), and Daniel stood firm (Daniel 3:17-18). Living Jehovah’s truth secures your future.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God.” <cite>—John 17:3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Your Decision</h2>
                <p>Indecision is defeat (James 1:8). Choose Jehovah’s Kingdom and truth—the meek “will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11). What will you choose today?</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind.” <cite>—James 1:6</cite>
