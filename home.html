        <h1>Satan’s World vs. Jehovah’s Wisdom</h1>

        <h2>The Ruler of This World: Satan’s Deception</h2>
        <p>The Bible identifies Satan as “the ruler of this world” who blinds people to the truth. He uses lies and distractions—wealth, power, and selfish desires—to trap humanity in a system opposed to Jehovah. This world’s ways promise happiness but deliver emptiness, as people chase fleeting pleasures instead of lasting peace. Satan’s influence began when he deceived Eve, and it continues today through pride and rebellion against God’s standards.</p>
        <p class="scripture">“The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” —1 John 5:19</p>

        <h2>Jehovah’s Wisdom: A Light in the Darkness</h2>
        <p>In contrast, Jehovah offers wisdom that leads to life. His Word teaches us to reject selfish ambition and pursue righteousness, humility, and love. Through the Bible, Jehovah reveals how to see through Satan’s schemes and find true purpose. This wisdom isn’t human—it’s divine, given to those who seek Jehovah with a sincere heart, trusting His guidance over the world’s noise.</p>
        <p class="scripture">“The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.” —Proverbs 9:10</p>

        <h2>Satan’s System: Temporary and Doomed</h2>
        <p>Satan’s world is built on sand—greed, violence, and immorality. The Bible warns that it’s temporary, soon to be replaced by Jehovah’s Kingdom. People may gain riches or fame, but these fade, leaving them unsatisfied. Satan tempts with instant gratification, but Jehovah promises something better: a future where “the meek will possess the earth” and live forever in peace.</p>
        <p class="scripture">“The world is passing away and so is its desire, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.” —1 John 2:17</p>

        <h2>Jehovah’s Way: Everlasting and True</h2>
        <p>Jehovah’s wisdom offers more than survival—it offers life without end. By studying His Word and applying it, we gain strength to resist Satan’s lures. Jesus showed this when he rejected Satan’s temptations, relying on Jehovah’s truth. We can too, choosing obedience over compromise, and finding joy in serving the God who never lies or fails.</p>
        <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</p>

        <h2>Choosing Wisely: The Decision Is Ours</h2>
        <p>Every day, we face a choice: follow Satan’s dying world or embrace Jehovah’s living wisdom. The Bible urges us to “keep on seeking first the Kingdom” and trust Jehovah’s promises over Satan’s illusions. History shows this world’s failures—wars, injustice, sorrow—but Jehovah’s wisdom points to a new world, soon to come, where His will prevails.</p>
        <p class="scripture">“Happy is the man who finds wisdom and the man who acquires discernment; it is more precious than corals, and nothing else you desire can compare to it.” —Proverbs 3:13, 15</p>
