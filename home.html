                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>The Bible identifies Satan as “the ruler of this world” who blinds people to the truth. He uses lies and distractions—wealth, power, and selfish desires—to trap humanity in a system opposed to Jehovah. This world’s ways promise happiness but deliver emptiness, as people chase fleeting pleasures instead of lasting peace. Satan’s influence began when he deceived Eve, and it continues today through pride and rebellion against God’s standards.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” —1 John 5:19</p>

                        <p>In contrast, Jehovah offers wisdom that leads to life. His Word teaches us to reject selfish ambition and pursue righteousness, humility, and love. Through the Bible, Jehovah reveals how to see through Satan’s schemes and find true purpose. This wisdom isn’t human—it’s divine, given to those who seek Jehovah with a sincere heart, trusting His guidance over the world’s noise.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.” —Proverbs 9:10</p>

                        <p>Satan’s world is built on sand—greed, violence, and immorality. The Bible warns that it’s temporary, soon to be replaced by Jehovah’s Kingdom. People may gain riches or fame, but these fade, leaving them unsatisfied. Satan tempts with instant gratification, but Jehovah promises something better: a future where “the meek will possess the earth” and live forever in peace.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The world is passing away and so is its desire, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.” —1 John 2:17</p>

                        <p>Jehovah’s wisdom offers more than survival—it offers life without end. By studying His Word and applying it, we gain strength to resist Satan’s lures. Jesus showed this when he rejected Satan’s temptations, relying on Jehovah’s truth. We can too, choosing obedience over compromise, and finding joy in serving the God who never lies or fails.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</p>

                        <p>Every day, we face a choice: follow Satan’s dying world or embrace Jehovah’s living wisdom. The Bible urges us to “keep on seeking first the Kingdom” and trust Jehovah’s promises over Satan’s illusions. History shows this world’s failures—wars, injustice, sorrow—but Jehovah’s wisdom points to a new world, soon to come, where His will prevails.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Happy is the man who finds wisdom and the man who acquires discernment; it is more precious than corals, and nothing else you desire can compare to it.” —Proverbs 3:13, 15</p>

        <!-- Featured Section 2: Truth or False Worship -->
        <div class="featured-section">

                <details>
                    <summary class="card-header">Truth or False Worship</summary>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>Worshiping Jehovah in truth is essential for everlasting life. The Bible warns that false worship, even with good intentions, leads to ruin, as seen with the Israelites and echoed in today’s practices.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must not have any other gods besides me.” —Exodus 20:3</p>

                        <p>The Israelites turned to pagan gods, like the golden calf, claiming it honored Jehovah (Exodus 32:4-6). God judged it idolatry, and thousands perished (Exodus 32:28). They later served Baal, offering children in fire (Jeremiah 19:5), a practice so vile that many died in the wilderness, never reaching the Promised Land (Numbers 14:29-30). Their error was blending pagan traditions with worship, defying Jehovah’s command.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They went mixing with the nations and learned their works.” —Psalm 106:35</p>

                        <p>Today, false worship thrives in traditions masquerading as faith. Christmas, tied to December 25, stems from Saturnalia, a Roman festival honoring the sun god Saturn, with trees and gift-giving rooted in pagan rituals—not Jesus’ birth, which the Bible doesn’t date. Easter mixes resurrection with fertility rites, like eggs and rabbits, linked to the goddess Eostre, not Scripture. The Trinity, a cornerstone for many, isn’t biblical—John 17:3 calls Jehovah “the only true God,” distinct from Jesus, yet it mirrors pagan triads from Babylon and Egypt. Birthdays, celebrated universally, originate in spiritism and astrology, with candles and wishes tied to ancient magic, not God’s approval.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Get out from among them, and separate yourselves... and quit touching the unclean thing.” —2 Corinthians 6:17</p>

                        <p>Going to "church" isn’t enough if they cling to these falsehoods. The Israelites believed in God yet fell; today, many profess faith but follow pagan-rooted customs, risking paradise. True worship requires rejecting these and seeking Jehovah’s truth in the Bible. Joshua and Caleb obeyed and entered Canaan (Joshua 14:6-9), showing that following Jehovah’s standards leads to life.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</p>

                        <p>Exploring truth means abandoning false worship for Jehovah’s way. The Bible promises a paradise where “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11), but only for those who worship “in spirit and truth” (John 4:23-24). Choosing truth over tradition secures a future where Jehovah’s will reigns (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.” —Isaiah 11:9</p>

                <details>
                    <summary class="card-header">Satan Owns The Fence</summary>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>The Bible leaves no room for indecision: if you don’t stand for Jehovah’s truth, you’ll fall for Satan’s lies. Sitting on the fence isn’t neutral—it’s a victory for the “father of the lie” (John 8:44). Satan thrives when people waver, offering a world of half-truths that lead to destruction.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of my mouth.” —Revelation 3:16</p>

                        <p>The Israelites tried to straddle both sides. They kept Jehovah’s name but bowed to Baal, burning incense to idols (2 Kings 17:16-17). Their compromise didn’t save them—God exiled them from the land (2 Kings 17:23). Refusing to fully reject lies cost them everything, proving Satan claims those who don’t choose truth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the Creator.” —Romans 1:25</p>

                        <p>Today, many sit on the fence, blending faith with Satan’s world. They pray to Jehovah but celebrate Christmas, a pagan sun-worship rite, or Easter, tied to fertility gods. They nod to the Trinity, a lie from Babylon, not the Bible, and blow out birthday candles, a ritual from spiritism. These aren’t harmless—they’re footholds for Satan, pulling people from truth into his domain.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other.” —Matthew 6:24</p>

                        <p>Standing for truth means rejecting Satan’s lies outright. Jesus didn’t waver when tempted (Matthew 4:10)—he chose Jehovah’s Word. The faithful remnant in Israel, like Daniel, stood firm against idolatry and lived (Daniel 3:17-18). Today, choosing truth over compromise leads to paradise, where lies have no place.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</p>

                        <p>Satan owns the fence—those who don’t decide for Jehovah fall to him. The Bible warns that indecision is a choice for lies (James 1:8). Stand for truth, and Jehovah promises a future where “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11). The choice is clear: truth brings life, the fence brings death.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about.” —James 1:6</p>
