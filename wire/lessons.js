        description: "The cross is not a Biblical symbol. Acts 5:30 says Jesus died on a stake (Greek: *xylon*), not a cross.

        description: "Hellfire is not Biblical. Romans 6:23 says, “The wages sin pays is death,” not torment. Jehovah, a God of love, does not burn people, as Ecclesiastes 9:5 confirms unconsciousness in death. Hellfire stems from Babylonian myths, unlike the Bible’s resurrection hope.

        scriptures: ["John 14:28", "1 Corinthians 11:3", "Deuteronomy 6:4"],
        description: "The Trinity is not Biblical. John 14:28 says, “The Father is greater than I am,” showing Jesus’ subordination. The term “Trinity” is absent from Scripture, rooted in Babylonian and Egyptian triads, as historical records show. Early Christians worshipped one God, Jehovah. Rejecting the Trinity ensures true worship, aligning with Jehovah’s clear truth and avoiding confusing pagan doctrines.",
