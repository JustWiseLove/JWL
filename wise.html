                        <p><strong>Biblical Guidance:</strong> Ezra studied Jehovah’s law diligently (Ezra 7:10). Jesus taught scripture as food (John 6:35). Neglecting study weakens faith, as “faith follows the things heard” (Romans 10:17).</p>

                        <p><strong>Biblical Insight:</strong> David found rest in Jehovah amid trials (Psalm 23:1-3). Jesus offered peace to disciples (John 16:33). Trust prevents anxiety, as “do not be anxious over anything” (Philippians 4:6).</p>
