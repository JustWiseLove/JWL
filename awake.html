                        <p>If you’ve had it rough—drugs, violence, neglect, or hitting rock bottom—you know pain that lingers. This world pushes temporary relief, like self-medication, but it’s a fleeting shadow. The Bible offers you something permanent: Jehovah’s strength to heal and a future to hold onto.</p>
                        <p>Jesus invites, “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you” (Matthew 11:28). Unlike quick fixes, Jehovah’s help lasts. When Israel groaned under Egypt’s chains around 1513 BCE, Jehovah promised, “I will take you to myself as a people” (Exodus 6:7). He sees you at your lowest and lifts you up: “Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves” (Psalm 34:18).</p>
                        <p>Tired of temporary patches? Jehovah offers real change. David, fleeing danger, trusted, “Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold” (Psalm 18:2), not worldly escapes. You’re called to a life awake, with hope for “a new heavens and a new earth” where “the former things will not be called to mind” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart.” —Psalm 34:18</p>

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>People who’ve had it rough—facing violence, addiction, or loss—often reach for something new, driven to change their outcome. Those who skate by or have it easy rarely dig deep; comfort lulls them into staying the same. The Bible shows why hardship fuels transformation and how Jehovah guides it.</p>
                        <p>Rahab, from a pagan city around 1473 BCE, hit a turning point. She chose Jehovah, saying, “Jehovah your God is God” (Joshua 2:11), and gained a new life as Jesus’ ancestor (Matthew 1:5). Hardship pushed her to act, unlike her neighbors who stayed put and perished. The Bible promises, “The one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <p>Those well-off naturally resist change; Israel, when prosperous, forgot Jehovah, following “the ways of the nations” (2 Kings 17:8). But you, tired of a rough path, seek better. Jehovah directs, “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you” (Ezekiel 36:26), turning your desire for change into a life that’s not just different, but his.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I will give you a new heart.” —Ezekiel 36:26</p>

                        <p>Tough times test faith, but enduring them builds trust in Jehovah, unlike those who face no difficulty and drift without purpose. Job’s story shows how suffering, when met with faith, proves devotion and brings Jehovah’s reward.</p>
                        <p>Job lost everything—family, wealth, health—yet declared, “Until I die, I will not renounce my integrity” (Job 27:5). Around 1473 BCE, his endurance answered Satan’s taunt, “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God?” (Job 1:9). Jehovah restored him double, proving, “Jehovah gives, and Jehovah takes away” (Job 1:21; 42:10). Your trials, too, can strengthen faith: “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13).</p>
                        <p>People who always have it easy don’t try for more; like Israel’s complacent kings, they fell when untested (Hosea 13:6). But you, forged in hardship, grow through endurance, as “tribulation produces endurance” (Romans 5:3). Jehovah sees your heart, promising, “I will cause you to become wise” (Psalm 51:6).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Until I die, I will not renounce my integrity.” —Job 27:5</p>

                        <p>Rough times often leave anger burning inside, a scar from violence or pain. The Bible warns against losing control and shows Jehovah’s way to heal, turning rage into peace for you and those you love.</p>
                        <p>Scripture says, “A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise man keeps himself under control” (Proverbs 29:11). Cain’s fury killed Abel, defying Jehovah’s warning, “Sin is crouching at the door” (Genesis 4:7). David, though, spared Saul: “I will not raise my hand against Jehovah’s anointed” (1 Samuel 26:11). Anger unchecked harms, as “the one who is quick to anger acts foolishly” (Proverbs 14:17).</p>
                        <p>Jehovah guides control: “Be agitated, but do not sin. Have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent” (Psalm 4:4). Jesus added, “Everyone who continues angry with his brother will be liable to judgment” (Matthew 5:22). Pray like Nehemiah—“I prayed to the God of the heavens” (Nehemiah 2:4)—and find “the peace of God that surpasses all understanding” (Philippians 4:7).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A wise man keeps himself under control.” —Proverbs 29:11</p>

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>If your childhood lacked love or time, you’re driven to give your children more—a home of faith and care. The Bible guides you to break the cycle, raising them with Jehovah’s truth for a different outcome.</p>
                        <p>Jehovah instructs, “These words that I am commanding you today must be on your heart, and you must inculcate them in your sons” (Deuteronomy 6:6-7). Eunice ensured Timothy knew “from infancy you have known the holy writings” (2 Timothy 3:15), despite obstacles. Your resolve mirrors this, giving what you missed.</p>
                        <p>Don’t repeat neglect, like Eli, whose sons died for his failure—“Jehovah’s word came against Eli” (1 Samuel 3:12). Instead, guide firmly: “Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it” (Proverbs 22:6). Jehovah promises, “I will pour out my spirit on your offspring” (Isaiah 44:3).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Train up a boy according to the way for him.” —Proverbs 22:6</p>

                        <p>Faith can divide you from family tied to your rough past. Jesus warned of this, but Jehovah helps you stand for truth, loving others without losing your way.</p>
                        <p>Jesus said, “I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother” (Matthew 10:35). Early Christians faced kin’s scorn yet held fast: “We must enter into the Kingdom of God through many tribulations” (Acts 14:22). You’re free to leave old ways—“a man will leave his father and mother” (Matthew 19:5).</p>
                        <p>Love doesn’t mean compromise. Jesus cared for his mother—“See! Your mother!” (John 19:27)—but served Jehovah first. Balance with peace: “If possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men” (Romans 12:18). Like Abraham leaving Ur (Genesis 12:4), choose Jehovah’s path, no matter who turns away.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I came to cause division.” —Matthew 10:35</p>

                        <p>When family rejects your faith, Jehovah gives you a better one—those who share his truth. This bond, unlike temporary ties, brings purpose and strength.</p>
                        <p>Jesus taught, “Whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, that one is my brother and sister and mother” (Matthew 12:50). He urged, “Make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19), and Paul said, “Let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith” (Galatians 6:10). Levi left his past to share truth (Luke 5:27-29).</p>
                        <p>Love kin, but don’t chase rejection: “Do not throw your pearls before swine” (Matthew 7:6). Faith might reach them—“she might save her husband” (1 Corinthians 7:16)—but your home is with Jehovah’s people, “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Especially toward those related to us in the faith.” —Galatians 6:10</p>

                        <p>Jesus urged, “Seek first the Kingdom and his righteousness” (Matthew 6:33). He stood firm: “The one who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me” (Matthew 10:37). Despite family doubts (Mark 3:21), he chose God. You don’t bend: “The one seeking the approval of men rather than that of God is not approved” (Galatians 1:10).</p>
                        <p>Live for Jehovah, like Ruth choosing Naomi’s God (Ruth 1:16). He promises, “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you” (James 4:8). Your life—raising children, mastering anger, shining true—proves, “Your labor is not in vain in the Lord” (1 Corinthians 15:58).</p>
