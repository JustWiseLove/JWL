                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>If you’ve come from a world of drugs, violence, or neglect, you know the weight of a rough past. This world offers quick fixes—self-medication, distractions—but they fade, leaving emptiness. The Bible invites you to something real, a life of purpose with Jehovah, who offers strength to heal and a future to hope for.</p>
                        <p>Jesus promised, “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you” (Matthew 11:28). Unlike temporary relief, Jehovah’s help endures. When the Israelites were trapped in Egypt’s oppression around 1513 BCE, Jehovah delivered them, saying, “I will take you to myself as a people” (Exodus 6:7). He sees your struggles and offers transformation, not just escape. The Bible assures, “Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves” (Psalm 34:18).</p>
                        <p>Self-medication numbs pain briefly, but Jehovah teaches lasting peace. David, hunted by Saul, found refuge not in worldly ways but in God: “Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold” (Psalm 18:2). You’re invited to build a life awake with purpose, looking to “a new heavens and a new earth” where “the former things will not be called to mind” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down.” —Matthew 11:28</p>

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>A rough upbringing—surrounded by drugs, violence, or absent parents—can feel like chains. Yet, the Bible shows you can break free, not by your own strength alone, but with Jehovah, who values your effort to choose a better path.</p>
                        <p>Joseph faced betrayal and slavery around 1728 BCE, yet refused to let his past define him. When tempted, he said, “How could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?” (Genesis 39:9). His faithfulness led to blessing: “God meant it for good” (Genesis 50:20). You, too, can rise above hardship, as “the one walking in his integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <p>Some stay trapped, like Israel, who followed “the ways of the nations” into ruin (2 Kings 17:8). But Jehovah honors change. Rahab, from a pagan life, chose faith: “Jehovah your God is God” (Joshua 2:11), and became Jesus’ ancestor (Matthew 1:5). Your past isn’t your fault, but your future is yours to shape with Jehovah, who promises, “I will give you a new heart” (Ezekiel 36:26).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one walking in his integrity will be saved.” —Proverbs 28:18</p>

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>Growing up with violence often leaves anger and aggression simmering inside. The Bible warns against losing control and shows how Jehovah helps you master emotions, replacing chaos with peace.</p>
                        <p>Scripture teaches, “A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise man keeps himself under control” (Proverbs 29:11). Cain’s rage led to murder, ignoring Jehovah’s plea: “If you do not turn to doing good, sin is crouching at the door” (Genesis 4:7). In contrast, David spared Saul, saying, “I will not raise my hand against Jehovah’s anointed” (1 Samuel 26:11), showing restraint that honored God.</p>
                        <p>Anger destroys, as “the one who is quick to anger acts foolishly” (Proverbs 14:17). Jesus urged, “Everyone who continues angry with his brother will be liable to judgment” (Matthew 5:22). To regain control, reflect quietly: “Be agitated, but do not sin. Have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent” (Psalm 4:4). Prayer, like Nehemiah’s—“I prayed to the God of the heavens” (Nehemiah 2:4)—restores calm, giving “the peace of God that surpasses all understanding” (Philippians 4:7).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A wise man keeps himself under control.” —Proverbs 29:11</p>

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>If your parents gave you little time, you long to give your children everything—love, guidance, faith. The Bible shows how to raise them with purpose, breaking the cycle of neglect for a legacy that honors Jehovah.</p>
                        <p>Jehovah commands, “These words that I am commanding you today must be on your heart, and you must inculcate them in your sons” (Deuteronomy 6:6-7). Eunice taught Timothy “from infancy you have known the holy writings” (2 Timothy 3:15), despite challenges. Your dedication can do the same, giving your kids what you missed.</p>
                        <p>Unlike Eli, whose sons fell because he didn’t correct them—“Jehovah’s word came against Eli” (1 Samuel 3:12)—you can guide firmly: “Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it” (Proverbs 22:6). Time spent teaching Jehovah’s truth builds hope, as “I will pour out my spirit on your offspring” (Isaiah 44:3).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Train up a boy according to the way for him.” —Proverbs 22:6</p>

                        <p>A rough past often ties to family who don’t understand your faith. Jesus warned that truth divides, but Jehovah helps you stand firm, loving others without bending to their ways.</p>
                        <p>Jesus said, “I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother” (Matthew 10:35). Faith separated early Christians from kin, yet they pressed on: “We must enter into the Kingdom of God through many tribulations” (Acts 14:22). You’re free to leave past patterns, as “a man will leave his father and mother” (Matthew 19:5).</p>
                        <p>Division doesn’t mean heartlessness. Jesus cared for his mother, saying to John, “See! Your mother!” (John 19:27), but didn’t waver from truth. Balance love with loyalty: “If possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men” (Romans 12:18). Jehovah strengthens you to choose him, as Abraham did, leaving Ur (Genesis 12:4).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I came to cause division.” —Matthew 10:35</p>

                        <p>Family may not share your faith, but Jehovah offers a true family—those who love his truth. Focusing here brings purpose, while still showing kindness to others.</p>
                        <p>Jesus defined family: “Whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, that one is my brother and sister and mother” (Matthew 12:50). He urged, “Make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19), and Paul added, “Let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith” (Galatians 6:10). Levi left his old life to share truth (Luke 5:27-29).</p>
                        <p>Relatives deserve love, but if they reject Jehovah, don’t waste effort: “Do not throw your pearls before swine” (Matthew 7:6). A wife’s faith might “save her husband” (1 Corinthians 7:16), but your heart belongs with those seeking God, building “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Especially toward those related to us in the faith.” —Galatians 6:10</p>

                        <p>You’re not here to fix others’ lives or please everyone. Jehovah teaches you to walk your path, faithful to him, without carrying burdens that aren’t yours.</p>
                        <p>The Bible says, “The soul who sins is the one who will die. A son will not bear the iniquity of his father” (Ezekiel 18:20). Israel’s rebels faced judgment, not Moses (Exodus 32:28). Paul wrote, “Each one will carry his own load” (Galatians 6:5). Jesus loved but spoke truth, calling out “hypocrites” (Matthew 23:13) while helping the humble (Luke 7:9-10).</p>
                        <p>Your life can shine—“a good tree cannot bear worthless fruit” (Matthew 7:18)—but others choose their way, like the prodigal son, welcomed only when he returned (Luke 15:20). Focus on Jehovah, trusting “he will render to each one according to his works” (Romans 2:6).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Each one will carry his own load.” —Galatians 6:5</p>

                        <p>Jesus said, “Seek first the Kingdom and his righteousness” (Matthew 6:33). He didn’t bend for family: “The one who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me” (Matthew 10:37). Despite doubts (Mark 3:21), he served God. You don’t need approval: “The one seeking the approval of men rather than that of God is not approved” (Galatians 1:10).</p>
                        <p>Love wisely, as Ruth chose Naomi’s God (Ruth 1:16), but live for Jehovah. He promises, “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you” (James 4:8). Your faithfulness—raising children, mastering emotions, shining brightly—builds a life awake, as “your labor is not in vain in the Lord” (1 Corinthians 15:58).</p>
