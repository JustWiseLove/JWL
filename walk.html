                        <h2>Fuel the Body for Service</h2>
                        <p>A balanced diet sustains physical strength for Jehovah’s service, as “whether you eat or drink, do all for God’s glory” (1 Corinthians 10:31). Moderation in food supports health and vigor.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Guidance:</strong> Daniel chose simple foods, thriving in Babylon (Daniel 1:8-16). Jesus ate modestly, sustained for ministry (John 4:31-34). Gluttony is warned against, as “put a knife to your throat if you are given to appetite” (Proverbs 23:2).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Eat whole foods, avoid excess, and prioritize health to preach and serve, as “your body is a temple” (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Gratitude for provisions fuels devotion (1 Timothy 6:8).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do all things for God’s glory.” — 1 Corinthians 10:31</p>

                        <h2>Labor for Jehovah’s Cause</h2>
                        <p>Physical work, like preaching and meeting attendance, is vital for serving Jehovah, as “go, make disciples of all nations” (Matthew 28:19). Diligent effort honors Him.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Examples:</strong> Paul labored, tentmaking while preaching (Acts 18:3-4). Nehemiah rebuilt Jerusalem’s walls, serving physically (Nehemiah 4:6). Their work advanced Jehovah’s purpose, as “whatever you do, do it heartily” (Colossians 3:23).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Schedule preaching, attend meetings, and maintain facilities, trusting “Jehovah will guard your going out” (Psalm 121:8).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Go, make disciples of all nations.” — Matthew 28:19</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Recharge to Serve Anew</h2>
                        <p>Physical rest, like sleep and balance, renews energy for service, as “Jehovah grants sleep to those he loves” (Psalm 127:2). Rest prevents burnout.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Insight:</strong> Jesus rested after ministry (Mark 6:31). The Sabbath taught balance (Exodus 20:8-11). Overwork is cautioned, as “better one handful with rest” (Ecclesiastes 4:6).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Prioritize sleep, take breaks, and trust Jehovah’s care, as “he gives strength to the weary” (Isaiah 40:29).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Come to me, and I will refresh you.” — Matthew 11:28</p>

                        <h2>Share Burdens in Service</h2>
                        <p>Physical collaboration, like group preaching, strengthens service, as “they were eating together with gladness” (Acts 2:46-47). Community lightens loads.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Examples:</strong> Early Christians shared resources (Acts 4:32-35). Nehemiah’s workers united for Jerusalem (Nehemiah 4:15-23). Unity aids service, as “a threefold cord is not easily broken” (Ecclesiastes 4:12).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Join group ministry, assist others, and build bonds, as “carry one another’s burdens” (Galatians 6:2).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Carry one another’s burdens.” — Galatians 6:2</p>

                        <h2>Organize for Effective Service</h2>
                        <p>Physical preparation, like time management, ensures fruitful service, as “count the cost” before building (Luke 14:28). Planning honors Jehovah.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Guidance:</strong> Joseph stored grain, preparing for famine (Genesis 41:35-36). Paul planned missionary journeys (Acts 15:36). Orderliness aids service, as “God is a God of order” (1 Corinthians 14:33).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Schedule ministry, budget resources, and prepare tools, as “the plans of the diligent lead to success” (Proverbs 21:5).</p>

                        <h2>Balance Sustains Service</h2>
                        <p>Physical moderation, avoiding excess in food or work, preserves health for service, as “let your moderation be known” (Philippians 4:5). Balance reflects wisdom.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Insight:</strong> Solomon warned against excess (Proverbs 25:16). Jesus lived simply, focused on service (Luke 9:58). Moderation aids endurance, as “run in a way to win” (1 Corinthians 9:24).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Limit indulgences, balance work and rest, and prioritize service, as “guard your heart” (Proverbs 4:23).</p>

                        <p>Physical endurance through health issues or persecution sustains service, as “we do not give up, though our outer man is wasting away” (2 Corinthians 4:16). Faith overcomes obstacles.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Examples:</strong> Job endured physical loss, trusting Jehovah (Job 1:20-22). Paul faced hardships, yet preached (2 Corinthians 11:23-27). Their resilience served Jehovah, as “Jehovah is my strength” (Isaiah 12:2).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Maintain health, face opposition boldly, and rely on Jehovah, as “he will make you firm” (1 Peter 5:10).</p>

                        <p>Gratitude for physical provisions, like food and shelter, motivates service, as “we have food and clothing, let us be content” (1 Timothy 6:8). Thankfulness honors Jehovah.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Insight:</strong> The Israelites thanked Jehovah for manna (Exodus 16:31-35). Paul was content in all circumstances (Philippians 4:11-12). Gratitude drives service, as “give thanks in everything” (1 Thessalonians 5:18).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Acknowledge provisions, share with others, and serve joyfully, as “Jehovah loves a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:7).</p>
