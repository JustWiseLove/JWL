How come my array needs commas but then it displays commas on the page?

            "<p>The Bible’s accurate teachings form the foundation of true worship guiding Jehovah’s Witnesses to honor Jehovah follow Jesus and prepare for His Kingdom. These truths proven by Scripture and practice lead to everlasting life.</p>",
            "<p><strong>Jehovah the Only True God</strong></p><p>Jehovah is the only true God identified by His name as Psalm 83:18 declares. Jesus His Son is subordinate sent to reveal Jehovah’s will (John 3:16). Unlike false gods Jehovah’s sovereignty is proven by His creation and prophecies. Jehovah’s Witnesses honor His name in 240+ lands distinguishing true worship from idolatry.</p><p><em>“That men may know that you whose name is Jehovah you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” — Psalm 83:18</em></p>",
            "<p><strong>Holy Spirit as God’s Active Force</strong></p><p>The Holy Spirit is Jehovah’s active force not a person used to inspire prophets and empower disciples (Acts 2:17). Unlike false views of a triune God Scripture shows it as God’s power like wind or fire guiding true worshipers. Jehovah’s Witnesses rely on this force to preach and live morally.</p><p><em>“I will pour out my spirit on all sorts of flesh and your sons and daughters will prophesy.” — Acts 2:17</em></p>",
            "<p><strong>God’s Kingdom and Its Rulers</strong></p><p>God’s Kingdom a heavenly government will restore earth under Christ (Daniel 2:44). The New Covenant selects 144000 anointed ones to rule as kings and priests (Luke 22:20; Revelation 14:1). This hope fulfilled since 1914 drives true worshipers to preach unlike human governments that fail.</p><p><em>“The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.” — Daniel 2:44</em></p>",
            "<p><strong>Death and Resurrection</strong></p><p>The dead are unconscious awaiting resurrection (Ecclesiastes 9:5). Jehovah’s Kingdom will resurrect billions to earth or heaven (John 5:28-29). Unlike false afterlife myths this truth comforts true worshipers as Jehovah’s Witnesses teach globally offering hope based on God’s justice.</p><p><em>“Do not be amazed at this for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” — John 5:28-29</em></p>",
            "<p><strong>Free Will and Moral Living</strong></p><p>Jehovah grants free will allowing humans to choose obedience (Deuteronomy 30:19). True worshipers like Jehovah’s Witnesses live simply avoiding materialism (1 Timothy 6:8). This contrasts with false teachings of fate or greed as the Bible’s moral guidance promotes peace and health.</p><p><em>“I have put life and death before you... choose life.” — Deuteronomy 30:19</em></p>",
            "<p><strong>Memorial of Christ’s Death</strong></p><p>Jehovah’s Witnesses commemorate Jesus’ death annually on Nisan 14 following his command (1 Corinthians 11:24). This simple ceremony—bread wine prayers—honors his ransom unlike pagan festivals. In 2024 over 20 million attended globally proving true worship’s devotion to Christ.</p><p><em>“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” — 1 Corinthians 11:24</em></p>",
            "<p><strong>Global Preaching and Unity</strong></p><p>True worshipers preach the Kingdom globally (Matthew 24:14) as Jehovah’s Witnesses do in 1000+ languages. Their unity with identical beliefs in 120000 congregations reflects God’s spirit (Psalm 133:1). Unlike divided religions this accuracy shows Jehovah’s blessing on true worship.</p><p><em>“This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth.” — Matthew 24:14</em></p>",
            "<p><strong>Bible’s Reliability and Discipline</strong></p><p>The Bible’s accuracy—scientific (Isaiah 40:22) historical (2 Kings 20:20) prophetic (Ezekiel 26:12)—guides true worship (Psalm 119:160). Baptism follows dedicated study (Acts 8:36) and discipline keeps congregations clean (1 Corinthians 5:13). Jehovah’s Witnesses uphold these truths unlike false religions.</p>"
