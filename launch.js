            <p>The Bible’s accurate teachings form the foundation of true worship guiding Jehovah’s Witnesses to honor Jehovah follow Jesus and prepare for His Kingdom. These truths proven by Scripture and practice lead to everlasting life.</p>
            <br><p><strong>Jehovah the Only True God</strong></p><p>Jehovah is the only true God identified by His name as Psalm 83:18 declares. Jesus His Son is subordinate sent to reveal Jehovah’s will (John 3:16). Unlike false gods Jehovah’s sovereignty is proven by His creation and prophecies. Jehovah’s Witnesses honor His name in 240+ lands distinguishing true worship from idolatry.</p><p><em>“That men may know that you whose name is Jehovah you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” — Psalm 83:18</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Holy Spirit as God’s Active Force</strong></p><p>The Holy Spirit is Jehovah’s active force not a person used to inspire prophets and empower disciples (Acts 2:17). Unlike false views of a triune God Scripture shows it as God’s power like wind or fire guiding true worshipers. Jehovah’s Witnesses rely on this force to preach and live morally.</p><p><em>“I will pour out my spirit on all sorts of flesh and your sons and daughters will prophesy.” — Acts 2:17</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>God’s Kingdom and Its Rulers</strong></p><p>God’s Kingdom a heavenly government will restore earth under Christ (Daniel 2:44). The New Covenant selects 144000 anointed ones to rule as kings and priests (Luke 22:20; Revelation 14:1). This hope fulfilled since 1914 drives true worshipers to preach unlike human governments that fail.</p><p><em>“The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.” — Daniel 2:44</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Death and Resurrection</strong></p><p>The dead are unconscious awaiting resurrection (Ecclesiastes 9:5). Jehovah’s Kingdom will resurrect billions to earth or heaven (John 5:28-29). Unlike false afterlife myths this truth comforts true worshipers as Jehovah’s Witnesses teach globally offering hope based on God’s justice.</p><p><em>“Do not be amazed at this for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” — John 5:28-29</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Free Will and Moral Living</strong></p><p>Jehovah grants free will allowing humans to choose obedience (Deuteronomy 30:19). True worshipers like Jehovah’s Witnesses live simply avoiding materialism (1 Timothy 6:8). This contrasts with false teachings of fate or greed as the Bible’s moral guidance promotes peace and health.</p><p><em>“I have put life and death before you... choose life.” — Deuteronomy 30:19</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Memorial of Christ’s Death</strong></p><p>Jehovah’s Witnesses commemorate Jesus’ death annually on Nisan 14 following his command (1 Corinthians 11:24). This simple ceremony—bread wine prayers—honors his ransom unlike pagan festivals. In 2024 over 20 million attended globally proving true worship’s devotion to Christ.</p><p><em>“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” — 1 Corinthians 11:24</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Global Preaching and Unity</strong></p><p>True worshipers preach the Kingdom globally (Matthew 24:14) as Jehovah’s Witnesses do in 1000+ languages. Their unity with identical beliefs in 120000 congregations reflects God’s spirit (Psalm 133:1). Unlike divided religions this accuracy shows Jehovah’s blessing on true worship.</p><p><em>“This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth.” — Matthew 24:14</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Bible’s Reliability and Discipline</strong></p><p>The Bible’s accuracy—scientific (Isaiah 40:22) historical (2 Kings 20:20) prophetic (Ezekiel 26:12)—guides true worship (Psalm 119:160). Baptism follows dedicated study (Acts 8:36) and discipline keeps congregations clean (1 Corinthians 5:13). Jehovah’s Witnesses uphold these truths unlike false religions.</p>

            <p>False teachings blaspheme Jehovah’s sovereignty, spreading lies that mislead billions with pagan rituals and doctrines. True worshipers reject these deceptions to honor Jehovah purely, avoiding the spiritual harm of false worship.</p>
            <br><p><strong>Trinity and False Gods</strong></p><p>The Trinity doctrine, formalized at Nicaea (325 CE), falsely claims Jehovah, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are one God, mimicking Babylonian triads (2000 BCE). Scripture declares one true God (1 Corinthians 8:6). This lie blasphemes Jehovah’s unique sovereignty, misleading billions in false worship.</p><p><em>“There is actually to us one God, the Father, from whom all things are.” — 1 Corinthians 8:6</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Hellfire and Immortal Soul</strong></p><p>Hellfire, rooted in Greek Hades (800 BCE), claims eternal torment, and the immortal soul myth, from Egyptian ka beliefs (3000 BCE), denies death’s unconsciousness (Psalm 146:4). These lies misrepresent Jehovah’s justice, scaring people from true worship, unlike the Bible’s resurrection hope.</p><p><em>“His spirit goes out, he returns to the ground; on that very day his thoughts perish.” — Psalm 146:4</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Karma and Fate</strong></p><p>Karma, from Hindu Vedas (1500 BCE), claims cosmic reward/punishment, and fate, from Chaldean astrology (2000 BCE), denies free will. Both contradict Jehovah’s gift of choice (Joshua 24:15). These lies blaspheme His sovereignty, trapping people in false destinies.</p><p><em>“Choose for yourselves today whom you will serve.” — Joshua 24:15</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Christmas and Easter</strong></p><p>Christmas, tied to Roman Saturnalia (200 BCE), honors sun gods with trees and lights, and Easter, from Saxon Eostre (700 CE), uses fertility symbols (eggs, rabbits). These pagan festivals (Isaiah 42:8) blaspheme Jehovah by blending idolatry with Jesus’ name, unlike true worship’s simplicity.</p><p><em>“I am Jehovah, that is my name; I give my glory to no one else.” — Isaiah 42:8</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Birthdays and Astrology</strong></p><p>Birthdays, linked to Egyptian pharaoh cults (2600 BCE), glorify self, and astrology, from Chaldean star charts (2000 BCE), predicts fate (Deuteronomy 18:10). These practices blaspheme Jehovah’s purpose (Psalm 36:9), diverting worshipers from His truth with pagan rituals.</p><p><em>“With you is the source of life; by your light we see light.” — Psalm 36:9</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Prosperity Gospel and Clergy Hypocrisy</strong></p><p>The prosperity gospel, from 1900s televangelists, falsely promises wealth as God’s will (Matthew 6:24), and hypocritical clergy, like Pharisees, preach but live immorally (Matthew 23:3). These lies exploit followers, blaspheming Jehovah’s generosity and justice.</p><p><em>“You cannot slave for God and for Riches.” — Matthew 6:24</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Evolution and Interfaith Compromise</strong></p><p>Evolution, from Darwin (1859), denies Jehovah’s creation (Genesis 1:27), and interfaith movements, since the 20th century, equate false gods with Jehovah (Deuteronomy 4:39). These lies blaspheme His role as Creator and sovereign, misleading people from true worship.</p><p><em>“God created man in his image.” — Genesis 1:27</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Non-Biblical Books and Ancestor Worship</strong></p><p>Non-biblical texts like the Quran or Vedas (Psalm 119:105), ancestor worship in Voodoo (Isaiah 8:19), and the cross symbol from Tammuz cults (Deuteronomy 4:16) contradict Scripture. These lies blaspheme Jehovah’s truth, promoting idolatry over pure worship.</p><p><em>“Your word is a lamp to my foot and a light to my path.” — Psalm 119:105</em></p>
