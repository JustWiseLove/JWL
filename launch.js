            <p>The Bible’s accurate teachings form the foundation of true worship guiding Jehovah’s Witnesses to honor Jehovah follow Jesus and prepare for His Kingdom. These truths proven by Scripture and practice lead to everlasting life.</p>
            <br><p><strong>Jehovah the Only True God</strong></p><p>Jehovah is the only true God identified by His name as Psalm 83:18 declares. Jesus His Son is subordinate sent to reveal Jehovah’s will (John 3:16). Unlike false gods Jehovah’s sovereignty is proven by His creation and prophecies. Jehovah’s Witnesses honor His name in 240+ lands distinguishing true worship from idolatry.</p><p><em>“That men may know that you whose name is Jehovah you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” — Psalm 83:18</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Holy Spirit as God’s Active Force</strong></p><p>The Holy Spirit is Jehovah’s active force not a person used to inspire prophets and empower disciples (Acts 2:17). Unlike false views of a triune God Scripture shows it as God’s power like wind or fire guiding true worshipers. Jehovah’s Witnesses rely on this force to preach and live morally.</p><p><em>“I will pour out my spirit on all sorts of flesh and your sons and daughters will prophesy.” — Acts 2:17</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>God’s Kingdom and Its Rulers</strong></p><p>God’s Kingdom a heavenly government will restore earth under Christ (Daniel 2:44). The New Covenant selects 144000 anointed ones to rule as kings and priests (Luke 22:20; Revelation 14:1). This hope fulfilled since 1914 drives true worshipers to preach unlike human governments that fail.</p><p><em>“The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.” — Daniel 2:44</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Death and Resurrection</strong></p><p>The dead are unconscious awaiting resurrection (Ecclesiastes 9:5). Jehovah’s Kingdom will resurrect billions to earth or heaven (John 5:28-29). Unlike false afterlife myths this truth comforts true worshipers as Jehovah’s Witnesses teach globally offering hope based on God’s justice.</p><p><em>“Do not be amazed at this for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” — John 5:28-29</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Free Will and Moral Living</strong></p><p>Jehovah grants free will allowing humans to choose obedience (Deuteronomy 30:19). True worshipers like Jehovah’s Witnesses live simply avoiding materialism (1 Timothy 6:8). This contrasts with false teachings of fate or greed as the Bible’s moral guidance promotes peace and health.</p><p><em>“I have put life and death before you... choose life.” — Deuteronomy 30:19</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Memorial of Christ’s Death</strong></p><p>Jehovah’s Witnesses commemorate Jesus’ death annually on Nisan 14 following his command (1 Corinthians 11:24). This simple ceremony—bread wine prayers—honors his ransom unlike pagan festivals. In 2024 over 20 million attended globally proving true worship’s devotion to Christ.</p><p><em>“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” — 1 Corinthians 11:24</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Global Preaching and Unity</strong></p><p>True worshipers preach the Kingdom globally (Matthew 24:14) as Jehovah’s Witnesses do in 1000+ languages. Their unity with identical beliefs in 120000 congregations reflects God’s spirit (Psalm 133:1). Unlike divided religions this accuracy shows Jehovah’s blessing on true worship.</p><p><em>“This good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth.” — Matthew 24:14</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Bible’s Reliability and Discipline</strong></p><p>The Bible’s accuracy—scientific (Isaiah 40:22) historical (2 Kings 20:20) prophetic (Ezekiel 26:12)—guides true worship (Psalm 119:160). Baptism follows dedicated study (Acts 8:36) and discipline keeps congregations clean (1 Corinthians 5:13). Jehovah’s Witnesses uphold these truths unlike false religions.</p>

            <p>False teachings blaspheme Jehovah’s sovereignty, spreading lies that mislead billions with pagan rituals and doctrines. True worshipers reject these deceptions to honor Jehovah purely, avoiding the spiritual harm of false worship.</p>
            <br><p><strong>Trinity and False Gods</strong></p><p>The Trinity doctrine, formalized at Nicaea (325 CE), falsely claims Jehovah, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are one God, mimicking Babylonian triads (2000 BCE). Scripture declares one true God (1 Corinthians 8:6). This lie blasphemes Jehovah’s unique sovereignty, misleading billions in false worship.</p><p><em>“There is actually to us one God, the Father, from whom all things are.” — 1 Corinthians 8:6</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Hellfire and Immortal Soul</strong></p><p>Hellfire, rooted in Greek Hades (800 BCE), claims eternal torment, and the immortal soul myth, from Egyptian ka beliefs (3000 BCE), denies death’s unconsciousness (Psalm 146:4). These lies misrepresent Jehovah’s justice, scaring people from true worship, unlike the Bible’s resurrection hope.</p><p><em>“His spirit goes out, he returns to the ground; on that very day his thoughts perish.” — Psalm 146:4</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Karma and Fate</strong></p><p>Karma, from Hindu Vedas (1500 BCE), claims cosmic reward/punishment, and fate, from Chaldean astrology (2000 BCE), denies free will. Both contradict Jehovah’s gift of choice (Joshua 24:15). These lies blaspheme His sovereignty, trapping people in false destinies.</p><p><em>“Choose for yourselves today whom you will serve.” — Joshua 24:15</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Christmas and Easter</strong></p><p>Christmas, tied to Roman Saturnalia (200 BCE), honors sun gods with trees and lights, and Easter, from Saxon Eostre (700 CE), uses fertility symbols (eggs, rabbits). These pagan festivals (Isaiah 42:8) blaspheme Jehovah by blending idolatry with Jesus’ name, unlike true worship’s simplicity.</p><p><em>“I am Jehovah, that is my name; I give my glory to no one else.” — Isaiah 42:8</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Birthdays and Astrology</strong></p><p>Birthdays, linked to Egyptian pharaoh cults (2600 BCE), glorify self, and astrology, from Chaldean star charts (2000 BCE), predicts fate (Deuteronomy 18:10). These practices blaspheme Jehovah’s purpose (Psalm 36:9), diverting worshipers from His truth with pagan rituals.</p><p><em>“With you is the source of life; by your light we see light.” — Psalm 36:9</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Prosperity Gospel and Clergy Hypocrisy</strong></p><p>The prosperity gospel, from 1900s televangelists, falsely promises wealth as God’s will (Matthew 6:24), and hypocritical clergy, like Pharisees, preach but live immorally (Matthew 23:3). These lies exploit followers, blaspheming Jehovah’s generosity and justice.</p><p><em>“You cannot slave for God and for Riches.” — Matthew 6:24</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Evolution and Interfaith Compromise</strong></p><p>Evolution, from Darwin (1859), denies Jehovah’s creation (Genesis 1:27), and interfaith movements, since the 20th century, equate false gods with Jehovah (Deuteronomy 4:39). These lies blaspheme His role as Creator and sovereign, misleading people from true worship.</p><p><em>“God created man in his image.” — Genesis 1:27</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Non-Biblical Books and Ancestor Worship</strong></p><p>Non-biblical texts like the Quran or Vedas (Psalm 119:105), ancestor worship in Voodoo (Isaiah 8:19), and the cross symbol from Tammuz cults (Deuteronomy 4:16) contradict Scripture. These lies blaspheme Jehovah’s truth, promoting idolatry over pure worship.</p><p><em>“Your word is a lamp to my foot and a light to my path.” — Psalm 119:105</em></p>

        "Hebrews 5:14 - Solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong."
    ],
    D: `
        <p>Discernment is the spiritual skill to distinguish true worship, approved by Jehovah, from false worship promoted by Satan. Through Bible study, prayer, and careful observation, Jehovah’s Witnesses develop this ability to navigate deception and honor Jehovah purely, preparing for everlasting life in His Kingdom.</p>
        <br><p><strong>Testing Teachings with Scripture</strong></p><p>Discernment begins by comparing every teaching to the Bible, as the Bereans did when they “examined the Scriptures daily” to verify Paul’s message. A teaching must align with Jehovah’s sovereignty and Jesus’ role as the truth. For example, does it uphold Jehovah as the only true God, or does it add human rules? True worship relies on Scripture alone, while false worship introduces traditions or philosophies that contradict God’s Word. To grow in discernment, study the Bible regularly to ensure your beliefs match its clear standards.</p><p><em>“They examined the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.” — Acts 17:11</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Recognizing Jehovah’s Name</strong></p><p>True worship centers on Jehovah’s name, which He declared as His memorial forever. Discernment involves checking if a religion boldly uses “Jehovah” in its teachings and prayers, as Jesus did when teaching his followers. Many religions replace Jehovah’s name with titles like “Lord” or “God,” obscuring His identity. This is a key sign of false worship. To sharpen discernment, notice whether a faith honors Jehovah’s name in its publications, songs, and preaching, reflecting its commitment to true worship.</p><p><em>“This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered.” — Exodus 3:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Spotting Pagan Influences</strong></p><p>Discernment helps identify pagan influences in worship, which Jehovah commands His people to avoid. Look for rituals, symbols, or festivals not found in the Bible, such as those tied to ancient idol worship. For example, does a religion use images or celebrate holidays with roots outside Scripture? True worship, as practiced by Jehovah’s Witnesses, remains free of such traditions, relying solely on God’s Word. To develop this skill, research the origins of religious practices and compare them to Jehovah’s standards for pure worship.</p><p><em>“Get out from among them, and separate yourselves, says Jehovah, and quit touching the unclean thing.” — 2 Corinthians 6:17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Evaluating Global Unity</strong></p><p>True worshipers are united worldwide, sharing the same beliefs and practices, as Jehovah desires. Discernment involves evaluating whether a religion demonstrates this unity across nations or is divided by conflicting doctrines. Jehovah’s Witnesses, for example, teach the same Bible truths in every country, reflecting God’s spirit. In contrast, false worship often shows division, with differing beliefs or practices. To grow in discernment, observe a religion’s consistency in its teachings and love among its members.</p><p><em>“How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” — Psalm 133:1</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Strengthening Discernment Through Study</strong></p><p>Regular Bible study sharpens discernment, training worshipers to distinguish right from wrong. By using tools like the New World Translation and Watchtower Library, Jehovah’s Witnesses verify teachings against Scripture, building spiritual maturity. False worship relies on human traditions or vague ideas, but true worshipers study diligently to understand Jehovah’s will. To develop this skill, set aside time daily to read the Bible, reflect on its principles, and discuss its truths with others, ensuring your faith rests on solid truth.</p><p><em>“Solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” — Hebrews 5:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Praying for Wisdom</strong></p><p>Discernment grows through heartfelt prayer to Jehovah, asking for wisdom to see truth clearly. Jesus set the example by praying for guidance during trials, relying on his Father’s direction. When faced with religious claims, pray to understand whether they align with Jehovah’s purpose. False worship lacks this reliance on God, but true worshipers trust Jehovah to guide them. To strengthen discernment, pray regularly, especially when making spiritual decisions, and trust Jehovah to reveal the right path.</p><p><em>“If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God, for he gives generously to all.” — James 1:5</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Observing Fruits of Worship</strong></p><p>Discernment involves examining a religion’s fruits, or results, to see if they reflect Jehovah’s blessing. Jesus taught that true worshipers produce good fruits, such as love, peace, and obedience to God’s commands. For example, Jehovah’s Witnesses show love through their global preaching and neutrality in conflicts. Religions marked by greed, division, or violence reveal false worship. To sharpen this skill, look at a faith’s actions—does it promote Jehovah’s standards or worldly values?</p><p><em>“By their fruits you will recognize them.” — Matthew 7:16</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Choosing the Narrow Path</strong></p><p>Discernment leads to the “narrow” path of true worship, which Jesus said few find. This path involves obeying Jehovah’s commands and rejecting popular but false religions. Check if a faith follows Jesus’ example of loyalty to Jehovah alone, as Jehovah’s Witnesses do by prioritizing Scripture over human traditions. False worship often appeals to the masses but leads to destruction. To develop discernment, choose beliefs that align with the Bible’s truth, even if they require sacrifice, for they lead to everlasting life.</p><p><em>“Go in through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading to destruction.” — Matthew 7:13</em></p>

        <p>Through endurance, Jehovah’s Witnesses faithfully share Bible truths, trusting in God’s power to make their efforts grow, as they teach about His Kingdom and its blessings for mankind.</p>
        <br><p><strong>Current Events Signal Change</strong></p><p>Current events and attitudes indicate a change is near, with wars, food shortages, earthquakes, and moral decline fulfilling Bible prophecy (Matthew 24:3, 7, 8; Luke 21:10, 11; 2 Timothy 3:1-5). These are signs of the last days, urging endurance in preaching Jehovah’s Kingdom as the solution.</p><p><em>“For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another.” — Matthew 24:7, 8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Earth Will Never Be Destroyed</strong></p><p>The earth will never be destroyed, as Jehovah established it to remain forever (Psalm 104:5; Ecclesiastes 1:4). True worshipers endure in teaching this hope, trusting in God’s promise for a lasting home for the righteous.</p><p><em>“He has established the earth on its foundations; it will not be moved from its place forever and ever.” — Psalm 104:5</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Earth’s Environment Restored</strong></p><p>The earth’s environment will be restored to paradise conditions under God’s Kingdom (Isaiah 35:1, 2; Revelation 11:18). Jehovah’s Witnesses endure in sharing this promise of a renewed earth, free from ruin and filled with beauty.</p><p><em>“The wilderness and the waterless region will exult, and the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron.” — Isaiah 35:1, 2</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Perfect Health for All</strong></p><p>Everyone will enjoy perfect health under God’s Kingdom, with no sickness or disability (Isaiah 33:24; 35:5, 6). This hope motivates endurance in teaching about Jehovah’s provision for eternal well-being.</p><p><em>“And no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’ The people dwelling in the land will be pardoned for their error.” — Isaiah 33:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Live Forever on Earth</strong></p><p>The righteous will live forever on a paradise earth, inheriting it as God’s gift (Psalm 37:29; Matthew 5:5). Endurance in preaching this truth prepares people for everlasting life under Jehovah’s rule.</p><p><em>“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” — Psalm 37:29</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Husbands Love Your Wives</strong></p><p>A husband should love his wife as himself, fostering a strong family bond (Ephesians 5:33; Colossians 3:19). Jehovah’s Witnesses endure in teaching biblical family values that honor Jehovah’s arrangement for marriage.</p><p><em>“Each one of you must love his wife as he does himself.” — Ephesians 5:33</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Wives Respect Your Husbands</strong></p><p>A wife should deeply respect her husband, supporting the family’s spiritual unity (Ephesians 5:33; Colossians 3:18). Endurance in upholding this principle strengthens marriages in harmony with Jehovah’s will.</p><p><em>“You wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as it is becoming in the Lord.” — Colossians 3:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Loyalty in Marriage</strong></p><p>A husband and wife should be loyal to each other, honoring Jehovah’s view of marriage (Malachi 2:16; Matthew 19:4-6, 9; Hebrews 13:4). Teaching this truth requires endurance to counter worldly views that undermine marital fidelity.</p><p><em>“Let marriage be honorable among all, and let the marriage bed be without defilement.” — Hebrews 13:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Children Obey Your Parents</strong></p><p>Children who respect and obey their parents will succeed, as this pleases Jehovah (Proverbs 1:8, 9; Ephesians 6:1-3). Endurance in teaching this builds strong families grounded in biblical principles.</p><p><em>“Children, be obedient to your parents in union with the Lord, for this is righteous.” — Ephesians 6:1</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>God Has a Name</strong></p><p>God’s name is Jehovah, and true worshipers use it with reverence (Psalm 83:18; Jeremiah 10:10). Enduring in proclaiming His name sets true worship apart from false religions that obscure it.</p><p><em>“May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” — Psalm 83:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>God Communicates Through Scripture</strong></p><p>Jehovah communicates with us through His inspired Word, guiding true worship (2 Timothy 3:16, 17; 2 Peter 1:20, 21).

        <br><p><strong>God Is Fair and Unbiased</strong></p><p>Jehovah is impartial, accepting all who fear Him and do right (Deuteronomy 10:17; Acts 10:34, 35). Enduring in sharing this truth invites people of all nations to worship the true God.</p><p><em>“God is not partial, but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.” — Acts 10:34, 35</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>God Helps Us</strong></p><p>Jehovah is a refuge, ready to help in times of distress (Psalm 46:1; 145:18, 19). Endurance in teaching this truth comforts those facing trials, pointing them to God’s support.</p><p><em>“God is our refuge and strength, a help that is readily found in times of distress.” — Psalm 46:1</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Pray to Jehovah</strong></p><p>Jehovah invites us to pray to Him, offering a refuge for our hearts (Psalm 62:8; 65:2; 1 Peter 5:7). Endurance in teaching prayer strengthens faith in Jehovah’s care and guidance.</p><p><em>“Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts before him.” — Psalm 62:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>How to Pray</strong></p><p>The Bible teaches us how to pray meaningfully, as Jesus showed (Matthew 6:7-13; Luke 11:1-4). Enduring in sharing this guidance helps people draw close to Jehovah through proper prayer.</p><p><em>“You must pray, then, this way: ‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.’” — Matthew 6:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Pray Often</strong></p><p>We should pray constantly to stay close to Jehovah (Matthew 7:7, 8; 1 Thessalonians 5:17).

        <br><p><strong>Jesus’ Teachings Work</strong></p><p>Jesus was a great teacher whose advice always brings success (Matthew 6:14, 15, 34; 7:12).

        <br><p><strong>Jesus Foretold Today’s Events</strong></p><p>Jesus prophesied events like wars and preaching that we see today (Matthew 24:3, 7, 8, 14; Luke 21:10, 11).

        <br><p><strong>Jesus Is Not God</strong></p><p>Jesus is subordinate to Jehovah, his Father, who is greater (John 14:28; 1 Corinthians 11:3). Endurance in teaching this distinction upholds Jehovah’s sovereignty against false doctrines.</p><p><em>“The Father is greater than I am.” — John 14:28</em></p>

        <br><p><strong>Dead Cannot Help or Harm</strong></p><p>The dead have no power to help or harm the living (Psalm 146:4; Ecclesiastes 9:6, 10).

        <br><p><strong>God Hates Hypocrisy</strong></p><p>Jehovah despises hypocrisy in worship, demanding genuine devotion (Isaiah 29:13; Micah 3:11; Mark 7:6-8).

        <p>Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, from Abel to modern times, shine as treasures, proclaiming His truth with unwavering faith.</p>
        <br><p><strong>Abel, Enoch, Noah: First Witnesses</strong></p><p>The earliest faithful servants, valued as treasures, witnessed for Jehovah’s righteousness in a corrupt world, proclaiming His truth with unwavering faith, as “the righteous will be remembered forever” (Psalm 112:6). Abel offered a sacrifice pleasing to Jehovah, testifying to his faith through obedient worship (Genesis 4:4). His offering, made “by faith,” earned divine approval (Hebrews 11:4). Though murdered by Cain, Abel’s witness endures, as his blood “cries out” for justice (Genesis 4:10). Enoch “walked with God,” boldly prophesying against wickedness (Jude 14-15). His preaching condemned a godless generation, and Jehovah “took him” to spare him death (Genesis 5:24; Hebrews 11:5), affirming his loyalty to divine truth. Noah, a “preacher of righteousness,” built the ark and warned of the Flood for 120 years (2 Peter 2:5; Genesis 6:3). Facing ridicule, he upheld Jehovah’s laws, saving his family through faith (Hebrews 11:7). His witness stands as a testament to obedience.</p><p><em>“By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain.” — Hebrews 11:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob: Patriarchal Witnesses</strong></p><p>The patriarchs, as treasured servants, established Jehovah’s covenant through unwavering faith, proclaiming His promises in a pagan world, as “the righteous will be remembered forever” (Psalm 112:6). Abraham, leaving Ur at Jehovah’s call, journeyed to Canaan, offering sacrifices and declaring Jehovah’s name (Genesis 12:1-4, 7-8). His obedience, tested by nearly sacrificing Isaac, earned him the title “friend of Jehovah” (James 2:23; Hebrews 11:8-10), forging a covenant for all nations. Isaac, trusting Jehovah’s promise, remained in Canaan despite famine, receiving divine confirmation of the covenant (Genesis 26:3-5). His peaceful resolve amid conflict testified to Jehovah’s guidance, as “I am the God of Abraham your father” (Genesis 26:24). Jacob, wrestling with trials, vowed loyalty to Jehovah, erecting altars at Bethel (Genesis 28:13-15; 35:1-3). His 12 sons formed Israel’s tribes, fulfilling Jehovah’s promise to multiply his offspring, as “I am with you” (Genesis 28:15).</p><p><em>“I will be with you.” — Genesis 28:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Moses, Samuel, Jeremiah: Prophetic Witnesses</strong></p><p>Israel’s prophets, as treasured servants, proclaimed Jehovah’s name and laws, guiding His people to true devotion, as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25). Moses, raised in Egypt, led Israel from slavery, receiving the Law at Sinai, declaring “Jehovah your God is one Jehovah” (Deuteronomy 6:4). He boldly confronted Pharaoh, proclaiming Jehovah’s name (Exodus 3:15), teaching Israel to worship Him alone (Exodus 20:3). Samuel, as prophet and judge, anointed Saul and David, urging Israel to serve Jehovah exclusively (1 Samuel 12:10-20). His tireless preaching strengthened devotion, as “serve Jehovah with all your heart” (1 Samuel 12:24). Jeremiah warned Judah of Babylon’s judgment, proclaiming “Jehovah is the true God” (Jeremiah 10:10). Imprisoned and mocked, he faithfully rewrote his burned scrolls (Jeremiah 36:32), testifying to Jehovah’s enduring word.</p><p><em>“This is my name forever.” — Exodus 3:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jesus, Peter, Paul: Apostolic Witnesses</strong></p><p>Jesus and His apostles, as priceless treasures, established Christian witnessing, proclaiming Jehovah’s Kingdom with steadfast faith, as “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). Jesus declared “I have made your name known” (John 17:26), teaching Jehovah’s purpose through parables and miracles (Matthew 4:17). He preached publicly and house-to-house (Luke 8:1), enduring death on a stake to uphold Jehovah’s sovereignty (Philippians 2:8). Peter, a leading apostle, preached at Pentecost, declaring Jehovah’s resurrection of Jesus (Acts 2:32-36). Imprisoned and beaten, he continued witnessing (Acts 5:42), stating “we must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29). Paul, converted from persecutor, traveled thousands of miles, establishing congregations and writing 14 epistles (Acts 9:15). Beheaded under Nero, he proclaimed “Jehovah is my helper” (Hebrews 13:6).</p><p><em>“Go, make disciples of all the nations.” — Matthew 28:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Perpetua: Early Martyrs</strong></p><p>Early Christians, like treasured gems, witnessed for Jehovah amid persecution, preserving His truth, as “be faithful even to death” (Revelation 2:10). Polycarp of Smyrna, a disciple of John, refused to honor false gods, declaring, “I am a Christian.” Burned at the stake in 155 CE, his martyrdom upheld Jehovah’s worship, as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25). Justin Martyr, a philosopher-turned-Christian, wrote *Apologies* defending Christianity, proclaiming Jehovah as the true God. Beheaded in 165 CE, his testimony strengthened early believers. Perpetua, a young mother, faced wild beasts in Carthage’s arena in 203 CE, declaring Jehovah’s Kingdom. Her courage bolstered Christian resolve.</p><p><em>“The word of our God endures forever.” — Isaiah 40:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Waldensians, Wycliffe, Tyndale: Reformation Translators</strong></p><p>Medieval and Reformation translators, as treasured servants, proclaimed Jehovah’s Word, making it accessible despite opposition, as “those seeking Jehovah will praise him” (Psalm 22:26). Waldensians, led by Peter Waldo in the 12th century, translated vernacular Bibles, sharing Jehovah’s truth with the poor. Persecuted, they hid in the Alps, proclaiming “worship with spirit and truth” (John 4:24). John Wycliffe’s English Bible (1382) gave access to Jehovah’s Word. Declared a heretic, his bones were burned after death, but his translations spread truth, as “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105). William Tyndale’s Pentateuch (1530) proclaimed Jehovah’s name (Exodus 6:3). Strangled and burned in 1536, his faith endured, as “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32).</p><p><em>“Your word is truth.” — John 17:17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Ainsworth, Grew, Storrs: Truth Seekers</strong></p><p>Early restorers, like precious treasures, proclaimed Jehovah’s truth, preparing the way for modern witnessing, as “Jehovah searches for those loyal to him” (2 Chronicles 16:9). Henry Ainsworth, a Puritan scholar, used “Jehovah” in his Psalms annotations (1612), citing Psalm 83:18. Exiled for his faith, his work spread Jehovah’s name, as “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1). Henry Grew taught Jehovah’s name and rejected false doctrines in the 1820s, facing opposition. His steadfastness reached many, as “the dead know nothing at all” (Ecclesiastes 9:5). George Storrs taught earthly resurrection through *Six Sermons* in the 1840s. Persecuted, his faith spread Jehovah’s truth, as “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11).</p><p><em>“My people will know my name.” — Isaiah 52:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Russell, Rutherford, Knorr: Modern Witnesses</strong></p><p>Modern witnesses, as treasured servants, globalized Jehovah’s truth through faith and sacrifice, as “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14). Charles Taze Russell, in 1870, formed a Pittsburgh Bible study, launching *Zion’s Watch Tower* (1879) to publish truth. Distributing millions of tracts amid mob violence, he founded the Watch Tower Society (1884), proclaiming Jehovah’s Kingdom, as “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10). Joseph Franklin Rutherford, succeeding Russell in 1917, faced imprisonment in 1918 for preaching truth. Naming the group Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1931, he spread Jehovah’s name via radio, as “proclaim his name among the peoples” (Psalm 105:1). Nathan H. Knorr, from 1942, trained missionaries through Gilead School (1943), sending them to 240 lands. His leadership expanded preaching, as “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p><p><em>“I did not hold back from preaching.” — Acts 20:20</em></p>

        <p><strong>Wisdom - Foolishness</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Wisdom:</strong></p><br><p>Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge in a way that pleases Jehovah. True wisdom begins with a reverent fear of God and leads to right decisions, clean conduct, and a meaningful life. Jehovah gives wisdom to those who ask with faith and seek his guidance in the Scriptures.</p><br><p><em>“The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.” — Proverbs 9:10</em></p><br><p><em>“Wisdom is the most important thing, so acquire wisdom.” — Proverbs 4:7</em></p><br><p><em>“If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God… and it will be given him.” — James 1:5</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Wisdom:</strong></p><br><p>Wisdom protects us from spiritual danger and helps us live in harmony with Jehovah’s principles. It strengthens our faith, improves our choices, and helps us lead others in a good way. Wise people build strong relationships and walk securely in Jehovah’s favor.</p><br><p><em>“Happy is the man who finds wisdom… It is more valuable than corals; nothing you desire can compare to it.” — Proverbs 3:13, 15</em></p><br><p><em>“The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil.” — Proverbs 14:16</em></p><br><p><em>“The wisdom from above is… first of all pure, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey.” — James 3:17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Foolishness:</strong></p><br><p>Foolishness in the Bible isn’t just about lacking knowledge—it often refers to ignoring Jehovah’s guidance and doing what is right in one’s own eyes. The foolish person acts without thought of consequences or respect for God. Such thinking is spiritually dangerous.</p><br><p><em>“The fool says in his heart: ‘There is no Jehovah.’” — Psalm 14:1</em></p><br><p><em>“Fools despise wisdom and discipline.” — Proverbs 1:7</em></p><br><p><em>“The heart of the wise one leads him in the right way, but the heart of the stupid one leads him in the wrong way.” — Ecclesiastes 10:2</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Foolishness:</strong></p><br><p>Foolishness can lead to sin, regret, and even spiritual ruin. It blinds a person to Jehovah’s loving direction and often results in harm to themselves and others. Jehovah encourages us to avoid the path of the foolish and walk with the wise instead.</p><br><p><em>“The wise one fears and turns away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.” — Proverbs 14:16</em></p><br><p><em>“A fool gives vent to all his feelings, but the wise one remains calm.” — Proverbs 29:11</em></p><br><p><em>“The one walking with the wise will become wise, but the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.” — Proverbs 13:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Holiness - Impurity</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Holiness:</strong></p><br><p>Holiness means being clean, set apart, and loyal to Jehovah. He is the ultimate example of holiness and calls his people to reflect this quality in their lives. Being holy involves avoiding moral uncleanness, staying spiritually clean, and keeping close to Jehovah.</p><br><p><em>“You must be holy, because I am holy.” — 1 Peter 1:16</em></p><br><p><em>“Pursue peace with all people and the sanctification [holiness] without which no man will see the Lord.” — Hebrews 12:14</em></p><br><p><em>“This is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality.” — 1 Thessalonians 4:3</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Holiness:</strong></p><br><p>Holiness helps us stay close to Jehovah and reflects our deep respect for him. It protects us from harmful influences and allows us to serve him acceptably. Those who are holy will be welcomed into his clean new world, where nothing defiled will exist.</p><br><p><em>“Happy are those who are pure in heart, since they will see God.” — Matthew 5:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” — 2 Corinthians 7:1</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah is near to all those calling on him… in trueness.” — Psalm 145:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Impurity:</strong></p><br><p>Impurity includes immoral thoughts, speech, or actions. It makes a person unclean before God and pushes them away from his favor. The Bible strongly warns against uncleanness and lists it among the behaviors that will prevent people from inheriting God’s Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“God gave them over to uncleanness in the desires of their hearts.” — Romans 1:24</em></p><br><p><em>“Let sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness… not even be mentioned among you.” — Ephesians 5:3</em></p><br><p><em>“The works of the flesh are… sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct… those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.” — Galatians 5:19, 21</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Impurity:</strong></p><br><p>Impurity stains our conscience and can damage our relationship with Jehovah. It invites pain, guilt, and consequences. Jehovah lovingly disciplines his people to keep them clean, because he wants them to enjoy a clean conscience and a hopeful future.</p><br><p><em>“Cleanse your hearts, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you indecisive ones.” — James 4:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor.” — 1 Thessalonians 4:4</em></p><br><p><em>“Flee from sexual immorality! Every other sin… is outside his body, but whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body.” — 1 Corinthians 6:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Gratitude - Ingratitude</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Gratitude:</strong></p><br><p>Gratitude is a sign of humility and appreciation. Jehovah loves when we express thanks for his blessings—both big and small. Jesus often thanked his Father, and we’re encouraged to follow his example by showing thankfulness in our prayers and actions.</p><br><p><em>“Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good; his loyal love endures forever.” — Psalm 107:1</em></p><br><p><em>“In everything give thanks. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus.” — 1 Thessalonians 5:18</em></p><br><p><em>“Whatever you are doing… do it in the name of the Lord Jesus, thanking God the Father through him.” — Colossians 3:17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Gratitude:</strong></p><br><p>Gratitude helps us see how much Jehovah has already done for us. It keeps us joyful and content even during trials. When we’re grateful, we’re less likely to complain or focus on what we lack. It strengthens our relationship with Jehovah and draws us closer to others.</p><br><p><em>“Do not be anxious over anything… but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.” — Philippians 4:6</em></p><br><p><em>“Let the peace of the Christ rule in your hearts… and show yourselves thankful.” — Colossians 3:15</em></p><br><p><em>“Offer thanksgiving as your sacrifice to God.” — Psalm 50:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Ingratitude:</strong></p><br><p>Ingratitude reflects a lack of appreciation for Jehovah’s kindness. It’s often linked with selfishness and arrogance. The Bible warns that people in the last days would be “unthankful,” showing how serious it is in Jehovah’s eyes.</p><br><p><em>“People will be… unthankful, disloyal.” — 2 Timothy 3:2</em></p><br><p><em>“Although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him.” — Romans 1:21</em></p><br><p><em>“You gave them a king, but in your indignation; you took him away, but in your fury.” — Hosea 13:11</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Ingratitude:</strong></p><br><p>Ingratitude can make us blind to Jehovah’s blessings. It leads to complaining, greed, and discontentment. Failing to thank Jehovah weakens our spirituality and can even cause us to drift away from him. A thankful heart, however, helps us remain faithful and joyful.</p><br><p><em>“How often they rebelled against him… They forgot his deeds and the wonderful works he had shown them.” — Psalm 78:40-42</em></p><br><p><em>“Guard against every sort of greed, because even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.” — Luke 12:15</em></p><br><p><em>“They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt.” — Psalm 106:21</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Forgiveness - Resentment</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Forgiveness:</strong></p><br><p>Forgiveness is a beautiful expression of love and mercy. Jehovah is the perfect example—he is “ready to forgive” those who repent. He also commands us to forgive others from the heart. True forgiveness brings peace and keeps bitterness out of our lives.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah is merciful and compassionate… He will not always find fault, nor will he stay angry forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins.” — Psalm 103:8-10</em></p><br><p><em>“Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely.” — Colossians 3:13</em></p><br><p><em>“If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.” — Matthew 6:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Forgiveness:</strong></p><br><p>When we forgive, we imitate Jehovah. Forgiveness frees us from anger and helps relationships heal. It also keeps us in Jehovah’s favor, since he will only forgive us if we forgive others. Forgiveness shows strength—not weakness—and brings peace of mind.</p><br><p><em>“Love covers over a multitude of sins.” — 1 Peter 4:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered.” — Psalm 32:1</em></p><br><p><em>“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.” — Colossians 3:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Resentment:</strong></p><br><p>Resentment is holding onto anger or bitterness, especially after being wronged. It poisons the heart and leads to hatred, division, and even revenge. The Bible warns that resentment is harmful and can separate us from God’s spirit.</p><br><p><em>“Let go of anger and abandon rage; do not become upset and turn to doing evil.” — Psalm 37:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not hate your brother in your heart.” — Leviticus 19:17</em></p><br><p><em>“Be wrathful, yet do not sin… Let the sun not set while you are still angry.” — Ephesians 4:26</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Resentment:</strong></p><br><p>Resentment keeps us from moving forward. It robs us of peace, damages our relationships, and makes us spiritually weak. Jehovah does not hold grudges—and neither should we. Releasing resentment allows us to be truly free and spiritually healthy.</p><br><p><em>“All bitterness, anger, wrath, shouting, and slander must be removed from you, along with all badness.” — Ephesians 4:31</em></p><br><p><em>“He who cannot forgive others destroys the bridge over which he himself must pass.” — Matthew 18:33</em></p><br><p><em>“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit.” — 2 Corinthians 7:1</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Loyalty - Betrayal</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Loyalty:</strong></p><br><p>Loyalty is a deep, faithful love that does not change, even in hard times. Jehovah is the perfect example of loyalty—he remains true to his promises and faithful to those who love him. In return, he expects his people to stay loyal to him, his Son, and one another.</p><br><p><em>“Your loyal love, O Jehovah, reaches to the heavens.” — Psalm 36:5</em></p><br><p><em>“Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” — Revelation 2:10</em></p><br><p><em>“Whoever remains loyal in a minor matter is also loyal in much.” — Luke 16:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Loyalty:</strong></p><br><p>Being loyal shows that we love Jehovah and trust him. It helps us stay firm during trials, support our spiritual family, and resist pressures from the world. Loyal friends are rare and precious, and Jehovah treasures loyal hearts.</p><br><p><em>“The eyes of Jehovah are on the faithful of the earth.” — Psalm 101:6</em></p><br><p><em>“A true friend shows love at all times and is a brother who is born for times of distress.” — Proverbs 17:17</em></p><br><p><em>“Love Jehovah your God with all your heart… and be loyal to him.” — Deuteronomy 30:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Betrayal:</strong></p><br><p>Betrayal breaks trust and causes deep pain. It shows selfishness and disloyalty, often for personal gain. Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus with a kiss—a tragic example of how far betrayal can go. The Bible clearly warns against this dangerous trait.</p><br><p><em>“Even the man at peace with me, one whom I trusted… has turned against me.” — Psalm 41:9</em></p><br><p><em>“Woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed!” — Mark 14:21</em></p><br><p><em>“A man lacking good sense betrays confidence.” — Proverbs 11:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Betrayal:</strong></p><br><p>Betrayal brings shame and regret, and it can destroy relationships permanently. Jehovah values loyalty, not people who switch sides or act treacherously. We should never imitate Satan, the ultimate betrayer of God’s trust.</p><br><p><em>“Traitors… have nothing to do with them.” — 2 Timothy 3:4, 5</em></p><br><p><em>“The one who slanders his neighbor is stupid.” — Proverbs 11:12</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah detests a person who causes division among brothers.” — Proverbs 6:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Obedience - Disobedience</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Obedience:</strong></p><br><p>Obedience is highly valued by Jehovah. It shows respect for his authority and love for his guidance. Even Jesus “learned obedience” during his time on earth. Obeying Jehovah leads to peace, protection, and blessings.</p><br><p><em>“To obey is better than a sacrifice.” — 1 Samuel 15:22</em></p><br><p><em>“This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome.” — 1 John 5:3</em></p><br><p><em>“Become doers of the word, and not hearers only.” — James 1:22</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Obedience:</strong></p><br><p>Obedience leads to life. When we follow Jehovah’s instructions, we show trust in his wisdom. It also keeps us safe from spiritual harm. Obedience helps us grow close to Jehovah and prepares us for future blessings in his Kingdom.</p><br><p><em>“Keep following the course of obedience to him, and cling to him, for he is your life.” — Deuteronomy 30:20</em></p><br><p><em>“If you listen to my commandments… I will give the rain for your land at its proper time.” — Deuteronomy 11:13-14</em></p><br><p><em>“The obedient one will eat the good things of the land.” — Isaiah 1:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Disobedience:</strong></p><br><p>Disobedience is rebellion against God’s authority. It began with Satan and led to the fall of Adam and Eve. The Bible warns that those who ignore Jehovah’s laws will not receive his favor. Disobedience brings sorrow, disorder, and ultimately destruction.</p><br><p><em>“They refused to listen… and they turned a stubborn shoulder.” — Zechariah 7:11</em></p><br><p><em>“God considers vengeance on those who do not obey.” — 2 Thessalonians 1:8</em></p><br><p><em>“The one who disregards this is disregarding, not man, but God.” — 1 Thessalonians 4:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Disobedience:</strong></p><br><p>Disobedience leads us away from Jehovah’s protection. It breaks our relationship with him and opens the door to sin. Those who keep ignoring his direction will face his judgment. That’s why cultivating a spirit of obedience is vital for our spiritual survival.</p><br><p><em>“By your stubbornness… you are storing up wrath for yourself.” — Romans 2:5</em></p><br><p><em>“They stumble because they are disobedient to the word.” — 1 Peter 2:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not be stiff-necked any longer, for Jehovah your God is the God of gods.” — Deuteronomy 10:16-17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Self-Control - Recklessness</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Self-Control:</strong></p><br><p>Self-control is a fruit of God’s spirit. It means having the strength to resist wrong desires, control our emotions, and make wise decisions. Jehovah and Jesus both show perfect self-control. Christians are encouraged to train themselves to think clearly and act with discipline.</p><br><p><em>“God gave us… power and self-control.” — 2 Timothy 1:7</em></p><br><p><em>“Like a city broken through and left without a wall is the man who cannot control his temper.” — Proverbs 25:28</em></p><br><p><em>“A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise person keeps it under control.” — Proverbs 29:11</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Self-Control:</strong></p><br><p>Having self-control protects us from harmful choices and keeps us close to Jehovah. It helps us avoid arguments, immoral acts, and regretful words. With self-control, we can resist temptation and remain calm under pressure.</p><br><p><em>“Train yourself with godly devotion.” — 1 Timothy 4:7</em></p><br><p><em>“Keep your senses, be watchful! Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion.” — 1 Peter 5:8</em></p><br><p><em>“But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been carried out, brings forth death.” — James 1:14-15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Recklessness:</strong></p><br><p>Recklessness is acting without thinking or care for consequences. It includes doing things impulsively, speaking without thought, or chasing selfish desires. The Bible links recklessness with foolishness and pride.</p><br><p><em>“The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.” — Proverbs 14:16</em></p><br><p><em>“The one who guards his mouth protects his life, but the one who talks too much will come to ruin.” — Proverbs 13:3</em></p><br><p><em>“He who hurries to be rich will not remain innocent.” — Proverbs 28:20</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Recklessness:</strong></p><br><p>Recklessness can lead to serious harm—for us and others. It causes bad decisions, damaged reputations, and spiritual danger. Jehovah wants us to be thoughtful and wise, not impulsive or careless. Avoiding reckless actions helps us stay faithful.</p><br><p><em>“And I have seen how much effort and skillful work spring from rivalry between people; this too is futility, a chasing after the wind.” — Ecclesiastes 4:4</em></p><br><p><em>“The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself, but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.” — Proverbs 22:3</em></p><br><p><em>“A wise person acts with knowledge, but the fool exposes his stupidity.” — Proverbs 13:16</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Honesty - Deceit</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Honesty:</strong></p><br><p>Honesty is a core part of Jehovah’s standards. He is “a God of truth,” and he expects his servants to speak truthfully and act with integrity. Honesty builds trust, keeps our conscience clean, and brings honor to Jehovah’s name.</p><br><p><em>“Do not lie to one another. Strip off the old personality with its practices.” — Colossians 3:9</em></p><br><p><em>“Each of you must speak truthfully with his neighbor.” — Ephesians 4:25</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah detests a lying tongue, but he delights in those dealing faithfully.” — Proverbs 12:22</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Honesty:</strong></p><br><p>Honesty protects us from guilt and regret. It helps us maintain strong relationships and reflect Jehovah’s qualities. Even when it’s difficult, being honest shows spiritual maturity and earns the respect of others. It helps others trust us and the message we share.</p><br><p><em>“We trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” — Hebrews 13:18</em></p><br><p><em>“Conduct yourselves honestly among the nations.” — 1 Peter 2:12</em></p><br><p><em>“Who may be a guest in your tent?… The one who walks faultlessly, practices what is right, and speaks the truth in his heart.” — Psalm 15:1-2</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Deceit:</strong></p><br><p>Deceit, or lying, is the opposite of Jehovah’s truth. Satan is the “father of the lie” (John 8:44), and lies always lead to trouble and harm. Jehovah hates falsehood and will not allow liars to remain among his people.</p><br><p><em>“You must not steal, you must not deceive, and you must not lie to one another.” — Leviticus 19:11</em></p><br><p><em>“The one hiding hatred has lying lips, and whoever spreads slander is stupid.” — Proverbs 10:18</em></p><br><p><em>“Outside are the dogs… and all those who love and practice lying.” — Revelation 22:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Deceit:</strong></p><br><p>Lies damage trust, destroy friendships, and can even cost us our relationship with Jehovah. A dishonest life leads to spiritual ruin. That’s why the Bible tells us to “safeguard our lips” and avoid deception in all things.</p><br><p><em>“A false witness will not go unpunished, and the one who lies with every breath will perish.” — Proverbs 19:9</em></p><br><p><em>“You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” — John 8:32</em></p><br><p><em>“Put away lies; speak truth each one with his neighbor.” — Zechariah 8:16</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Peace - Conflict</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Peace:</strong></p><br><p>Peace is one of the beautiful qualities that come from Jehovah. True peace means more than just the absence of fighting—it includes harmony, calmness, and unity with others and with God. Jehovah is called the “God of peace,” and he wants his people to pursue peace in every part of their lives.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah will bless his people with peace.” — Psalm 29:11</em></p><br><p><em>“If possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men.” — Romans 12:18</em></p><br><p><em>“Happy are the peacemakers, since they will be called sons of God.” — Matthew 5:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Peace:</strong></p><br><p>Peace allows us to live calmly, make wise choices, and stay close to Jehovah. It helps us stay united with our Christian brothers and sisters. When we act as peacemakers, we imitate Jehovah and help create a peaceful atmosphere in the congregation and in our families.</p><br><p><em>“Let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that build one another up.” — Romans 14:19</em></p><br><p><em>“Clothe yourselves with… peace.” — Colossians 3:12, 15</em></p><br><p><em>“Those who love your law enjoy abundant peace.” — Psalm 119:165</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Conflict:</strong></p><br><p>Conflict often comes from pride, selfishness, and lack of love. It leads to division and harm. The Bible shows that stirring up arguments and fights is a sign of spiritual weakness. Jehovah does not approve of those who cause strife.</p><br><p><em>“Hatred stirs up conflicts, but love covers over all transgressions.” — Proverbs 10:12</em></p><br><p><em>“Where there are jealousy and contentiousness, there will also be disorder and every vile thing.” — James 3:16</em></p><br><p><em>“A man given to anger stirs up strife.” — Proverbs 29:22</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Conflict:</strong></p><br><p>Conflict destroys relationships, breaks down unity, and drives away Jehovah’s spirit. If we allow conflict to grow in our hearts, it can damage our spiritual health. Jehovah wants us to turn away from arguing and be quick to forgive and make peace.</p><br><p><em>“Stop being quarrelsome… be gentle toward all.” — 2 Timothy 2:24</em></p><br><p><em>“Let all bitterness and anger… be removed from you.” — Ephesians 4:31</em></p><br><p><em>“Anyone loving a quarrel loves transgression.” — Proverbs 17:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Patience - Impatience</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Patience:</strong></p><br><p>Patience is a key quality for true Christians. It means calmly enduring difficult situations without giving in to anger or frustration. Jehovah is described as patient, giving people time to change and respond to his guidance. When we are patient, we reflect his love and mercy.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah is compassionate and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love.” — Psalm 103:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Clothe yourselves with… patience.” — Colossians 3:12</em></p><br><p><em>“The end of a matter is better than its beginning; better to be patient than to be haughty in spirit.” — Ecclesiastes 7:8</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Patience:</strong></p><br><p>Patience helps us endure trials, get along with others, and wait for Jehovah’s promises. It protects us from saying or doing things we later regret. Developing patience helps us become mature Christians who are better equipped to face tests of faith.</p><br><p><em>“By your endurance you will preserve your lives.” — Luke 21:19</em></p><br><p><em>“Let endurance complete its work, so that you may be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything.” — James 1:4</em></p><br><p><em>“Love is patient and kind.” — 1 Corinthians 13:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Impatience:</strong></p><br><p>Impatience often leads to harsh speech, rash actions, and a lack of self-control. It can show a lack of trust in Jehovah’s timing. The Bible warns that impatient people are more likely to fall into anger or discouragement, which can harm their spiritual progress.</p><br><p><em>“Do not be quick to take offense, for the taking of offense lodges in the bosom of fools.” — Ecclesiastes 7:9</em></p><br><p><em>“An impatient man stirs up strife.” — Proverbs 15:18</em></p><br><p><em>“A fool gives vent to all his feelings, but the wise one calmly keeps them in check.” — Proverbs 29:11</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Impatience:</strong></p><br><p>Impatience can make us act without wisdom or love. It can damage relationships and push us away from Jehovah’s ways. When we give in to impatience, we stop waiting on Jehovah and may try to take matters into our own hands.</p><br><p><em>“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good… Wait eagerly for Jehovah, and he will rescue you.” — Psalm 37:3, 34</em></p><br><p><em>“Let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out.” — Galatians 6:9</em></p><br><p><em>“The one who trusts in Jehovah will possess the land.” — Psalm 37:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Kindness - Cruelty</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Kindness:</strong></p><br><p>Kindness is a quality that reflects Jehovah’s personality. It involves showing compassion, gentleness, and care for others, even when it’s not required. Jehovah expects his servants to be kind in speech and action, treating others with dignity and respect.</p><br><p><em>“Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you.” — Ephesians 4:32</em></p><br><p><em>“But the fruitage of the spirit is… kindness.” — Galatians 5:22</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah is righteous in all his ways and loyal in all his works. Jehovah is near to all those calling on him… He satisfies the desire of those who fear him.” — Psalm 145:17-19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Kindness:</strong></p><br><p>Kindness softens hearts, promotes peace, and strengthens the congregation. It draws others to the truth and shows that we are imitating Jehovah and Christ. When we are kind, even in difficult situations, we become a powerful example of true Christian love.</p><br><p><em>“A kind man benefits himself, but a cruel man brings trouble on himself.” — Proverbs 11:17</em></p><br><p><em>“Clothe yourselves with… kindness.” — Colossians 3:12</em></p><br><p><em>“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you.” — Matthew 7:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Cruelty:</strong></p><br><p>Cruelty is the opposite of Jehovah’s loving personality. It involves harshness, coldness, and intentional harm. The Bible shows that cruelty reflects a lack of mercy and love, and it causes pain to others. Jehovah disapproves of those who act with cruelty or violence.</p><br><p><em>“They sharpen their tongue like a sword; they aim their cruel words like arrows.” — Psalm 64:3</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one; He hates anyone who loves violence.” — Psalm 11:5</em></p><br><p><em>“The merciful one is kind to his own soul, but the cruel person brings trouble on himself.” — Proverbs 11:17</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Cruelty:</strong></p><br><p>Cruelty harms our relationships and damages our conscience. It makes us unlike Jehovah, who is tender and compassionate. Cruel actions and speech push others away and can destroy unity in the congregation. We must reject cruelty in all its forms to reflect God’s love.</p><br><p><em>“Remove abusive speech from your mouth.” — Colossians 3:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be removed from among you, along with all badness.” — Ephesians 4:31</em></p><br><p><em>“Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.” — Matthew 5:7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Humility - Pride</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Humility:</strong></p><br><p>Humility is a precious quality that Jehovah loves. A humble person recognizes their need for God, does not boast, and treats others with respect. Humility allows us to accept correction, follow direction, and give glory to Jehovah instead of ourselves.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah is high, but he takes note of the humble.” — Psalm 138:6</em></p><br><p><em>“He has told you, O man, what is good. And what is Jehovah requiring of you? Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty, and to walk modestly with your God!” — Micah 6:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Humble yourselves in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will exalt you.” — James 4:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Humility:</strong></p><br><p>Humility helps us grow spiritually and maintain peace with others. It keeps us from becoming self-important or hard to work with. Jehovah blesses those who are humble, and Jesus himself set the perfect example of humility that we should follow.</p><br><p><em>“All of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble.” — 1 Peter 5:5</em></p><br><p><em>“Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for yourselves.” — Matthew 11:29</em></p><br><p><em>“For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.” — Matthew 23:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Pride:</strong></p><br><p>Pride is dangerous and leads to spiritual downfall. A proud person often relies on themselves rather than Jehovah, and may look down on others. The Bible repeatedly warns that pride leads to destruction and keeps people from recognizing their need for God.</p><br><p><em>“Pride is before a crash, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.” — Proverbs 16:18</em></p><br><p><em>“Jehovah detests everyone who is arrogant.” — Proverbs 16:5</em></p><br><p><em>“I will put an end to the pride of the mighty, and their sanctuaries will be profaned.” — Ezekiel 7:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Pride:</strong></p><br><p>Pride makes us unapproachable, unteachable, and distant from Jehovah. It can cause arguments, block spiritual growth, and lead to sin. Avoiding pride keeps us close to Jehovah and helps us maintain good relationships in the congregation.</p><br><p><em>“God opposes the haughty ones but gives undeserved kindness to the humble.” — James 4:6</em></p><br><p><em>“Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with humility consider others superior to you.” — Philippians 2:3</em></p><br><p><em>“Let the one who boasts, boast in Jehovah.” — 1 Corinthians 1:31</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Faith - Doubt</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Faith:</strong></p><br><p>Faith is essential for pleasing Jehovah. It means trusting fully in God even when we don’t see the outcome. True faith is not just belief—it’s proven by our actions. The Bible praises faithful men and women who obeyed Jehovah despite trials and uncertainty.</p><br><p><em>“Moreover, without faith it is impossible to please God well, for whoever approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” — Hebrews 11:6</em></p><br><p><em>“Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.” — Hebrews 11:1</em></p><br><p><em>“Indeed, we live by faith, not by sight.” — 2 Corinthians 5:7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Faith:</strong></p><br><p>Faith keeps us strong during hard times and helps us stay close to Jehovah. It gives us courage, peace, and endurance. When we have faith, we are not shaken by doubts or fear, and we can confidently rely on Jehovah’s promises.</p><br><p><em>“Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding.” — Proverbs 3:5</em></p><br><p><em>“For we are saved through faith, and this not because of ourselves, it is God’s gift.” — Ephesians 2:8</em></p><br><p><em>“Fight the fine fight of the faith; get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called.” — 1 Timothy 6:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Doubt:</strong></p><br><p>Doubt can weaken our relationship with Jehovah and cause us to hesitate when we need to act with trust. The Bible shows that those who doubt are unstable and can be easily misled. Doubt is the opposite of relying on Jehovah’s wisdom.</p><br><p><em>“But let him keep asking in faith, not doubting at all, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about.” — James 1:6</em></p><br><p><em>“The one who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not out of faith. For whatever is not out of faith is sin.” — Romans 14:23</em></p><br><p><em>“You of little faith, why did you give way to doubt?” — Matthew 14:31</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Doubt:</strong></p><br><p>Doubt robs us of peace and confidence in Jehovah. It can lead us to rely on ourselves instead of God and may cause us to shrink back when we should move forward. Removing doubt helps us grow stronger in faith and please Jehovah more fully.</p><br><p><em>“If anyone shrinks back, I have no pleasure in him.” — Hebrews 10:38</em></p><br><p><em>“Trust in Jehovah forever, for Jah Jehovah is the eternal Rock.” — Isaiah 26:4</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not be anxious over anything… let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God… will guard your hearts and your mental powers.” — Philippians 4:6-7</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Love - Hate</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Love:</strong></p><br><p>Love is the foundation of true worship and the most important quality we can show. Jehovah himself is described as love, and everything he does is motivated by it. The Bible makes it clear that love should guide all our thoughts, actions, and relationships.</p><br><p><em>“God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in union with God and God remains in union with him.” — 1 John 4:16</em></p><br><p><em>“‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. The second, like it, is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’” — Matthew 22:37-39</em></p><br><p><em>“Little children, let us love, not in word or with the tongue, but in deed and truth.” — 1 John 3:18</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Love:</strong></p><br><p>Love shows we truly follow Jesus and helps us stay united with others. Without love, our faith is meaningless. Love motivates us to be kind, forgiving, and peaceable. It strengthens the congregation and reflects Jehovah’s own qualities.</p><br><p><em>“By this all will know that you are my disciples—if you have love among yourselves.” — John 13:35</em></p><br><p><em>“Above all things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.” — Colossians 3:14</em></p><br><p><em>“If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a sounding piece of brass… and if I have all the faith so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.” — 1 Corinthians 13:1-2</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Hate:</strong></p><br><p>Hate is a harmful quality that leads to division, cruelty, and even spiritual ruin. It shows a lack of love and can damage relationships, the congregation, and our standing with Jehovah. The Bible strongly warns against hatred.</p><br><p><em>“Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has everlasting life remaining in him.” — 1 John 3:15</em></p><br><p><em>“Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen… hatred, strife, jealousy… those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.” — Galatians 5:19-21</em></p><br><p><em>“Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in the darkness.” — 1 John 2:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Hate:</strong></p><br><p>Hating others blocks our relationship with Jehovah. It makes us spiritually blind and can lead to cruel actions. Jehovah himself hates unjust hatred, and if we hold onto it, we are not imitating him. Replacing hate with love protects our hearts and brings peace.</p><br><p><em>“Anyone who does not love has not come to know God, because God is love.” — 1 John 4:8</em></p><br><p><em>“There are six things that Jehovah hates… a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood.” — Proverbs 6:16-17</em></p><br><p><em>“He who hates his brother is in the darkness… and he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.” — 1 John 2:11</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Diligence - Laziness</strong></p><br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Diligence:</strong></p><br><p>Diligence means being hardworking, dependable, and persistent—especially in our service to Jehovah. A diligent person gives their best and doesn’t give up easily. The Bible praises those who are “zealous,” “whole-souled,” and “not sluggish” in doing what is right.</p><br><p><em>“The plans of the diligent surely lead to success.” — Proverbs 21:5</em></p><br><p><em>“Whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah, and not for men.” — Colossians 3:23</em></p><br><p><em>“Do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit. Slave for Jehovah.” — Romans 12:11</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Have Diligence:</strong></p><br><p>Diligence shows that we value Jehovah’s service and the responsibilities he gives us. It brings satisfaction, helps us grow spiritually, and keeps us ready for any test of faith. Jehovah blesses the efforts of those who keep working faithfully.</p><br><p><em>“Become steadfast, immovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain.” — 1 Corinthians 15:58</em></p><br><p><em>“The hand of the diligent will rule, but the lazy one will be put to forced labor.” — Proverbs 12:24</em></p><br><p><em>“Let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out.” — Galatians 6:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>What the Bible Thinks About Laziness:</strong></p><br><p>Laziness is often connected with selfishness, lack of faith, and a poor spiritual outlook. The Bible warns that laziness leads to poverty, ruin, and spiritual sleep. A lazy person may avoid work, but in the end, it costs them more.</p><br><p><em>“The lazy one says: ‘There is a lion outside! I will be killed in the public square!’” — Proverbs 22:13</em></p><br><p><em>“The desire of the lazy will kill him, for his hands refuse to work.” — Proverbs 21:25</em></p><br><p><em>“Go to the ant, you lazy one; observe its ways and become wise.” — Proverbs 6:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Why We Should Not Have Laziness:</strong></p><br><p>Laziness can damage our relationship with Jehovah, prevent growth, and make us vulnerable to temptation. It reflects spiritual carelessness. Jehovah wants us to be alert, busy in his service, and productive in our daily life.</p><br><p><em>“How long will you lie there, you lazy one? When will you rise from your sleep?” — Proverbs 6:9</em></p><br><p><em>“The one not working should not eat.” — 2 Thessalonians 3:10</em></p><br><p><em>“Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.” — 1 Corinthians 16:13</em></p>

            <p>Jehovah’s Word, proven authentic through its inspired origins, unity, and enduring evidence, stands as the complete guide to truth, distinct from all other books.</p>
            <br><p><strong>Hebrew Scriptures Begin: Divine Origin</strong></p><br><p>The Bible’s canon began around 1513 BCE with the Hebrew Scriptures, when Moses, guided by Jehovah’s spirit, wrote the first five books—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This date is inferred from biblical chronology and paleographic analysis of inscriptions like the Gezer Calendar (10th century BCE). Jehovah Himself initiated this sacred work, inscribing the Ten Commandments on stone tablets (Exodus 31:18) and commanding Moses to record His laws (Exodus 34:27). These writings, forming the Pentateuch, established Israel’s covenant with Jehovah, reflecting divine inspiration through their harmony and fulfilled prophecy, such as the 70-year exile foretold in Jeremiah 29:10, which history confirms ended in 537 BCE with Cyrus’ decree (Ezra 1:1-4).</p><br><p>Their authenticity is evident in their focus on Jehovah’s worship, free from uninspired additions, and their preservation beside the ark (Deuteronomy 31:26). Archaeological finds like the Silver Scrolls (carbon-14 dated to 600 BCE) with “YHWH” blessings affirm their early use. Unlike other ancient texts, such as the Egyptian Book of the Dead, which mixes superstition with mythology, the Pentateuch’s historical accuracy and prophetic reliability set it apart, fulfilling “the saying of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25).</p><br><p><em>“The saying of Jehovah endures forever.” — 1 Peter 1:25</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Hebrew Canon Established: Inspired Selection</strong></p><br><p>By the end of the fifth century BCE, the Hebrew canon was finalized at 39 books (or 24 in Jewish tradition), a process guided by divine inspiration through scribes like Ezra, a skilled priest (Ezra 7:6), and Nehemiah. This timeline is supported by historical records and textual analysis of the Septuagint (280 BCE). Books from Joshua to Malachi, written by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, were recognized for turning people to Jehovah’s worship, showing harmony with His purpose, and fulfilling prophecy, such as Isaiah 44:28 naming Cyrus 150 years before his birth, verified by the Cyrus Cylinder (circa 539 BCE).</p><br><p>Jesus and the apostles exclusively quoted these books (e.g., Matthew 11:10 citing Malachi), and no post-Malachi writings (circa 443 BCE) were included, confirming the canon’s closure without human councils. The Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE) match later Masoretic texts, proving textual fidelity. Unlike the Apocrypha, which lacks prophetic power and contains errors (e.g., Judith’s historical inaccuracies), the Hebrew canon’s divine criteria ensure “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16) for salvation.</p><br><p><em>“All Scripture is inspired of God.” — 2 Timothy 3:16</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Christian Greek Scriptures Emerge: Apostolic Writings</strong></p><br><p>The Christian Greek Scriptures, adding 27 books, were written between 41 and 98 CE by apostles and disciples like Paul, John, and Luke, under holy spirit’s guidance. This timeline is based on historical evidence, such as Paul’s imprisonment (Acts 28:30, circa 61 CE), and paleographic dating of early manuscripts like the Rylands Papyrus P52 (circa 125 CE). These writings, including the Gospels and epistles, built on the Hebrew Scriptures, detailing Jesus’ life and Jehovah’s Kingdom, with fulfilled prophecies like Micah 5:2 predicting Bethlehem as Jesus’ birthplace (Matthew 2:6).</p><br><p>First-century Christians, gifted with “discernment of inspired expressions” (1 Corinthians 12:10), accepted these books, rejecting uninspired works like the Gospel of Thomas, which lacks apostolic authority and promotes Gnostic contradictions. The unity of these writings, despite authors’ diverse backgrounds—from fishermen (Peter) to physicians (Luke)—underscores their divine origin, fulfilling “the word of God is alive” (Hebrews 4:12) with a trustworthy message.</p><br><p><em>“The word of God is alive.” — Hebrews 4:12</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Christian Canon Finalized: Evidence of Completeness</strong></p><p>By the late second century CE, the Christian Greek Scriptures’ canon was finalized, totaling 66 books, as seen in early catalogs like the Muratorian Fragment (circa 170 CE) and over 5,200 Greek manuscripts. This closure followed John’s death around 98 CE, after which no new inspired writings emerged. Each book met divine criteria: turning to Jehovah’s worship, avoiding superstition, and harmonizing with the whole, as “men spoke from God” (2 Peter 1:21). For example, Revelation’s prophecy of “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5) aligns with earlier scriptures on false religion.</p><br><p>Jesus’ and the apostles’ use of both testaments (e.g., Acts 15:15-18 citing Amos) confirms a consistent catalog. Early codices like Codex Sinaiticus (paleography dated 325–350 CE) preserve this canon, excluding apocryphal works like the Book of Enoch, which contradicts scripture with mythical elements. This divine selection ensures “we have the prophetic word made more sure” (2 Peter 1:19) in its entirety.</p><br><p><em>“We have the prophetic word made more sure.” — 2 Peter 1:19</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Writers’ Honesty in Admitting Failures: Uncommon Integrity</strong></p><br><p>The Bible’s trustworthiness is reinforced by its writers’ rare honesty in admitting their failures, a trait absent in most ancient texts. Moses recorded his killing of an Egyptian (Exodus 2:12), yet Jehovah used him to lead Israel. David confessed his adultery with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah (2 Samuel 11:14-17), yet his repentance shines in Psalm 51. Peter admitted denying Jesus three times (Matthew 26:75), yet his growth is evident in 1 Peter 1:3. This transparency, spanning centuries, reflects holy spirit’s guidance, as “men spoke from God” (2 Peter 1:21).</p><br><p>Unlike other religious works, such as the Quran, which idealizes its figures (e.g., Muhammad’s portrayal in Surah 33:21), the Bible’s candor about human flaws demonstrates authenticity. The Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE) and early codices preserve these accounts, showing consistency. This honesty builds trust, fulfilling “the word of God is alive” (Hebrews 4:12) as a truthful record.</p><br><p><em>“The word of God is alive.” — Hebrews 4:12</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Diverse Authors Across Lands and Cultures: United in Truth</strong></p><p>The Bible’s 40 authors, writing over 1,600 years, spanned diverse lands and cultures yet delivered a unified message, proving its divine origin. Moses wrote in Egypt’s wilderness, David in Israel’s palaces, Jeremiah in Judah’s courts, Paul traveled from Jerusalem to Rome, and John recorded from Patmos. They included shepherds (Amos), kings (Solomon), fishermen (Peter), and a physician (Luke), using Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, from 1513 BCE to 98 CE, as dated by biblical chronology and manuscripts like Papyrus P46 (circa 200 CE).</p><br><p>Unlike fragmented texts like the Vedas, compiled over centuries with conflicting teachings, the Bible’s consistency—seen in prophecies like Daniel 9:24-27 predicting Jesus’ arrival—reflects holy spirit’s guidance, as “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16). The Dead Sea Scrolls and early codices (paleography dated 325–350 CE) confirm this unity across regions like Mesopotamia, Canaan, and Asia Minor, fulfilling “we have the prophetic word made more sure” (2 Peter 1:19).</p><br><p><em>“We have the prophetic word made more sure.” — 2 Peter 1:19</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Distinction from Other Writings: Superior Evidence</strong></p><br><p>The Bible’s authenticity stands out against other religious writings through its superior evidence and divine criteria. Unlike the Book of Mormon, which lacks archaeological support (e.g., no evidence for its cities like Zarahemla), the Bible’s historical accuracy is verified by artifacts like the Tel Dan Stele (circa 840 BCE) mentioning the “House of David.” The Bible’s 66 books show prophetic fulfillment—e.g., Isaiah 44:28 naming Cyrus, confirmed by the Cyrus Cylinder (539 BCE)—while texts like the Quran lack predictive prophecy, relying on later traditions (Hadith) without manuscript support until centuries later.</p><br><p>The Bible’s manuscript evidence, with over 24,000 copies (e.g., Codex Vaticanus, dated 325 CE via paleography), far exceeds the 1,500 for the Iliad or the few dozen for the Vedas. Its internal harmony, despite diverse authors, contrasts with the contradictions in apocryphal works like the Gospel of Thomas, which promotes Gnosticism incompatible with scripture. This distinction, rooted in Jehovah’s guidance, ensures “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8) as the true Word.</p><br><p><em>“The word of our God endures forever.” — Isaiah 40:8</em></p>
            <br><p><strong>Historical Spread and Preservation: Enduring Trustworthiness</strong></p><br><p>The Bible’s trustworthiness is proven by its global spread and meticulous preservation since the first century CE. Early Christians copied and shared the Greek Scriptures, as seen in the Rylands Papyrus P52 (dated 125 CE via paleography) found in Egypt. By the 4th century, codices like Sinaiticus (dated 325–350 CE via paleography) reached the Roman Empire, and the Latin Vulgate spread across Europe by the Middle Ages. Today, the Bible exists in over 3,000 languages, with 240 million New World Translation copies distributed globally, supported by over 24,000 manuscripts, far surpassing other ancient works like the Iliad’s 1,500 copies.</p><br><p>Despite persecution, Jehovah preserved His Word, as seen in the Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE) matching modern texts. Artifacts like the Moabite Stone (840 BCE) confirm its historical accuracy, unlike the Book of Mormon’s lack of evidence. This enduring reach and preservation fulfill “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10), proving the Bible’s authenticity as God’s complete Word.</p><br><p><em>“You are my witnesses,” says Jehovah. — Isaiah 43:10</em></p>

        <p><strong>Jehovah’s Name</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s name stands as the most significant and sacred identifier in all of Scripture, appearing over 7,000 times in the original Hebrew and Greek texts, a frequency that highlights its unparalleled importance to true worship and understanding the Creator. This divine name, represented by the Hebrew Tetragrammaton (YHWH), translates to “He Causes to Become,” a meaning that encapsulates Jehovah’s role as the purposeful and dynamic Creator who brings His will into reality. The Bible emphatically states, “I am Jehovah; that is my name; I give my glory to no one else, nor my praise to carved images” (Isaiah 42:8), making it clear that Jehovah alone is worthy of exclusive devotion and that He refuses to share His unique identity with any false god or idol. This name was first revealed to Moses around 1513 BCE at the burning bush, a dramatic encounter where Jehovah declared, “This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation” (Exodus 3:15). That revelation was not just a label but a promise tied to His eternal purpose—to transform the earth into a paradise populated by perfect humans, as He originally commanded Adam and Eve, saying, “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it” (Genesis 1:28). Jesus, Jehovah’s obedient Son, reinforced the sanctity of this name by teaching his followers to pray, “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified” (Matthew 6:9), and by affirming, “I have made your name known to them and will make it known, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them” (John 17:26). These statements underscore that knowing and honoring Jehovah’s name is not optional but essential to having a genuine relationship with Him and receiving His blessings.</p><br><p>Despite its importance, Satan, the great enemy of Jehovah, has waged a relentless campaign to erase this name from human awareness, a battle that traces back to Nimrod’s rebellion at Babel around 2269 BCE. At that time, rebellious humans gathered to build a tower and declared, “Come, let us build a city for ourselves and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves” (Genesis 11:4), an act of defiance against Jehovah’s authority that sought to elevate human pride over divine rule. This event set the stage for Satan’s ongoing efforts to obscure Jehovah’s identity, a strategy that gained traction centuries later when Jewish scribes, around 300 BCE, began avoiding pronouncing the divine name out of superstition, substituting it with titles like “Adonai” (Lord). This practice carried over into many Bible translations, where “LORD” in all capital letters replaced Jehovah’s name, a move that dilutes His personal identity and fosters confusion about who the true God is. Yet, Jehovah’s mighty acts throughout history shout His name louder than any human effort can silence it. For instance, around 1473 BCE, He parted the Red Sea, where “the waters were split apart” (Exodus 14:21), and then drowned Pharaoh’s pursuing army, as “the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen” (Exodus 14:27-28), proving that no power can stand against the One whose name is above all. Similarly, when Jehovah brought down the walls of Jericho around the same period, “the wall fell flat” (Joshua 6:20) at His command, a physical demonstration of His sovereignty that echoes the declaration, “Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God and the King forever” (Jeremiah 10:10). These events serve as undeniable evidence that Jehovah’s name represents His active presence and unmatched power in the universe.</p><br><p><em>“You will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.” — Jeremiah 29:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Historical Suppression</strong></p><br><p>The suppression of Jehovah’s name didn’t stop with ancient superstitions; it intensified as false religion grew in the early centuries of the Common Era, particularly by the third century CE, when apostate Christians began adopting pagan practices and titles that further distanced them from the true God. During this period, the influence of Greek philosophy and Roman traditions crept into the emerging church, leading to a deliberate effort to replace Jehovah’s name with generic terms like “God” or “Lord,” a shift that aligned with the blending of Christian teachings with pagan beliefs. However, Jehovah promised that this erasure would not last forever, as He foretold through the prophet Isaiah, “My people will know my name; therefore in that day they will know that I am the one speaking—here I am” (Isaiah 52:6). This prophecy is being fulfilled today as the truth about His name is restored, supported by historical evidence such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in 1947 but dated to around 200 BCE, which contain numerous instances of the Tetragrammaton in its original Hebrew form. These ancient manuscripts refute claims that Jehovah’s name is irrelevant or outdated, proving that it was cherished and used by His faithful servants long before false traditions took hold. Moreover, archaeological finds like the Moabite Stone, from around 840 BCE, mention “YHWH,” further confirming that Jehovah’s name was known and revered in ancient times, even among neighboring nations. This historical record stands as a testament to Jehovah’s enduring identity and His determination to be known by His people, just as He promised, “You will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you” (Jeremiah 29:12).</p><br><p><em>“You will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.” — Jeremiah 29:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Fate vs. Free Will</strong></p><br><p>One of Satan’s most insidious lies, propagated through ancient Babylonian astrology around 2000 BCE, is the concept of fate—an unchangeable destiny that strips humans of choice and accountability, locking them into a predetermined path they cannot escape. This belief, which spread through cultures like the Babylonians and later the Greeks, suggested that the stars or gods dictated every event, leaving no room for personal decision or divine mercy. In stark contrast, Jehovah’s Word dismantles this falsehood by affirming the gift of free will, as He told the Israelites, “See, I have set before you today life and good, and death and bad... therefore choose life so that you and your offspring may live” (Deuteronomy 30:19-20). This command makes it clear that humans are not puppets controlled by fate but beings created with the ability to choose their course, a freedom that reflects Jehovah’s justice and love. A powerful example of this principle is seen in His dealings with Nineveh around 830 BCE, when He sent Jonah to warn that wicked city of impending destruction, saying, “Only forty days more, and Nineveh will be overthrown” (Jonah 3:4). Yet, when the Ninevites repented, “God saw their works—that they had turned back from their evil ways—and he felt regret over the calamity that he had spoken of bringing on them, and he did not bring it” (Jonah 3:10). This dramatic turnaround proves that Jehovah responds to human choices, not a fixed destiny, and that He delights in mercy when people turn to Him, as He says, “I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked one should turn back from his way and live” (Ezekiel 33:11). Thus, the lie of fate is exposed as a tool of Satan to rob humans of hope, while Jehovah’s truth offers freedom and life through the exercise of free will in harmony with His will.</p><br><p><em>“You will call me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.” — Jeremiah 29:12</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Sovereignty</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s sovereignty is the supreme authority He holds as the Creator and Ruler of the universe, a right He alone possesses, as the Bible declares, “Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over everything” (Psalm 103:19). This sovereignty was challenged in Eden around 4026 BCE, when Satan deceived Eve, implying Jehovah’s rule was restrictive, saying, “Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden?” (Genesis 3:1). This rebellion escalated at Babel around 2269 BCE, where humans sought to defy Jehovah’s authority, declaring, “Let us make a celebrated name for ourselves” (Genesis 11:4). Jehovah’s response was swift—He confused their languages and scattered them, proving “there is no one like me” (Isaiah 46:9). Throughout history, He has vindicated His sovereignty through mighty acts, such as delivering Israel from Egypt around 1513 BCE, when He declared, “I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt. I am Jehovah” (Exodus 12:12). His parting of the Red Sea, where “the waters were split apart” (Exodus 14:21), and the destruction of Pharaoh’s army, “not one of them remained” (Exodus 14:28), demonstrated that no power can usurp His rule. Jesus upheld this sovereignty, teaching, “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service” (Matthew 4:10), a principle that guides true worshipers to honor Jehovah’s rightful place as King.</p><br><p>Satan’s challenge continues today, as human governments and false religions defy Jehovah’s authority, but His Word assures their end, for “the kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” (Revelation 11:15). The prophecy of Daniel’s statue, struck by “the stone” of God’s Kingdom (Daniel 2:44), foretells the collapse of all human rule, a process that began in 1914 when Christ was enthroned. Jehovah’s sovereignty is not just power but justice and love, as He promises, “My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please” (Isaiah 46:10), ensuring a paradise earth where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over everything.” — Psalm 103:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Vindication Through History</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah has consistently vindicated His sovereignty against challengers. Around 1473 BCE, He crushed Korah’s rebellion against Moses’ authority, when “the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up” (Numbers 16:32), proving His appointed leadership is inviolable. In 539 BCE, He toppled Babylon, as “the kingdom was given to the Medes and Persians” (Daniel 5:28), fulfilling His word through Isaiah, who named Cyrus 200 years earlier (Isaiah 44:28). These acts show Jehovah’s control over history, as “he changes times and seasons; he removes kings and sets up kings” (Daniel 2:21). Archaeological evidence, like the Cyrus Cylinder from 539 BCE, confirms His precise fulfillment, reinforcing that “Jehovah of armies has sworn: ‘As I have thought, so it will happen’” (Isaiah 14:24).</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over everything.” — Psalm 103:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Future Triumph</strong></p><br><p>At Armageddon, Jehovah’s sovereignty will be fully vindicated, as “he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God” (Revelation 19:15), destroying all who oppose Him, for “the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war” but are defeated (Revelation 19:19-21). This final act will usher in a world where “every knee will bend to me” (Isaiah 45:23), and His name will be universally known, fulfilling “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). True worshipers align with this now, proclaiming His rule, as “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rules over everything.” — Psalm 103:19</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Attributes</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s attributes—love, justice, wisdom, and power—define His character and set Him apart as the only true God, as the Bible states, “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth” (Exodus 34:6). His love is evident in creating humans for life, saying, “Be fruitful and become many” (Genesis 1:28), and providing the ransom through Jesus, “for God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son” (John 3:16). His justice shines in His impartiality, “there is no injustice with Jehovah our God, nor partiality” (2 Chronicles 19:7), seen when He judged Israel’s idolatry, “Jehovah’s anger blazed against them” (Numbers 25:3). His wisdom crafted the universe, “how many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom” (Psalm 104:24), from DNA’s complexity to earth’s ecosystems. His power, “everlasting strength” (Isaiah 26:4), parted the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21) and will resurrect billions, as “all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out” (John 5:28-29). These attributes demand worship, as “you must love Jehovah your God with all your heart” (Deuteronomy 6:5).</p><br><p>Satan distorts these attributes, painting Jehovah as cruel or weak, but His actions refute this. When He spared Nineveh after their repentance, “he did not bring the calamity” (Jonah 3:10), His mercy shone. His destruction of Sodom, “sulfur and fire from Jehovah” (Genesis 19:24), upheld justice. True worshipers reflect His qualities, “be imitators of God, as beloved children” (Ephesians 5:1), living by His standards.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.” — Exodus 34:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Balancing Attributes</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah perfectly balances His attributes, never compromising one for another. His love does not excuse sin, as “he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished” (Nahum 1:3), shown when He struck Uzziah with leprosy for pride (2 Chronicles 26:19). His justice offers mercy, “return to me, and I will return to you” (Zechariah 1:3), as when He forgave David’s repentance, “Jehovah has pardoned your sin” (2 Samuel 12:13). His wisdom ensures His purpose, “my word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11), and His power guarantees it, “nothing is too extraordinary for Jehovah” (Genesis 18:14).</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.” — Exodus 34:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Human Reflection</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah calls His servants to mirror His attributes, “be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16). Love drives preaching, “love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:39); justice guides fairness, “do not pervert justice” (Deuteronomy 16:19); wisdom shapes decisions, “the wisdom from above is first of all pure” (James 3:17); and power comes from His spirit, “you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you” (Acts 1:8). By imitating Jehovah, “we might become imitators of him” (1 Corinthians 11:1), true worshipers honor His name.</p><br><p><em>“Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.” — Exodus 34:6</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Purpose</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s purpose is to restore the earth to a paradise where righteous humans live forever, fulfilling His original intent in Eden, “he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18). He tasked Adam and Eve, “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it” (Genesis 1:28), a plan disrupted by sin but not abandoned, as “my purpose will stand” (Isaiah 46:10). Through Jesus’ ransom, “a ransom in exchange for many” (Matthew 20:28), Jehovah ensures “the righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29). His Kingdom, established in 1914, will “crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44), transforming earth into a world where “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24). This purpose drives history, from the Flood, “every living thing was wiped out” (Genesis 7:23), to Israel’s deliverance, “I am Jehovah your God” (Exodus 6:7), proving His unwavering commitment. True worshipers align with this, praying, “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10), and preaching, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p>Satan opposes this purpose, promoting rebellion and lies, but Jehovah’s victories—Babylon’s fall in 539 BCE, “the kingdom was given to the Medes and Persians” (Daniel 5:28)—show his defeat is certain, “the Devil was hurled into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:10). The earth’s design, with its perfect ecosystems, confirms Jehovah’s intent, “he did not create it simply for nothing” (Isaiah 45:18).</p><br><p><em>“My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.” — Isaiah 46:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Steps to Fulfillment</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s purpose unfolds through His covenants: the Abrahamic, “all the families of the ground will be blessed by means of you” (Genesis 12:3); the Mosaic, “you will be my special possession” (Exodus 19:5); and the new covenant, “by virtue of my blood” (Luke 22:20). Each step advances His plan, culminating in Christ’s rule, “he must rule as king” (1 Corinthians 15:25). The resurrection, “both the righteous and the unrighteous” (Acts 24:15), ensures all can benefit, as “death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4).</p><br><p><em>“My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.” — Isaiah 46:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Human Role</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah invites humans to share in His purpose, “seek Jehovah while he may be found” (Isaiah 55:6), by obeying His laws, “keep my commandments and live” (Proverbs 7:2), and preaching His Kingdom, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). When Israel obeyed, “Jehovah blessed them” (Deuteronomy 28:2); when they rebelled, “I disciplined them” (Hosea 10:10). Today, true worshipers fulfill this role, “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14), ensuring His purpose triumphs.</p><br><p><em>“My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.” — Isaiah 46:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Worship</strong></p><br><p>Worshiping Jehovah is the highest calling, requiring exclusive devotion, as He commands, “You must not have any other gods besides me” (Exodus 20:3). Jesus clarified, “You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth” (John 4:24), a lifestyle of obedience, not ritual, as “the one doing the will of my Father” enters the Kingdom (Matthew 7:21). This worship began in Eden, where Adam was to “cultivate and take care of it” (Genesis 2:15), and continued through faithful ones like Abel, whose offering “Jehovah looked with favor” (Genesis 4:4). Jehovah demands purity, striking Nadab and Abihu for “unauthorized fire” (Leviticus 10:1-2), and unity, “one faith, one baptism” (Ephesians 4:5). His worshipers preach globally, “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14), a work unbroken since Jesus’ day, “teaching and proclaiming the good news” (Luke 8:1). Satan’s false religions, “Babylon the Great” (Revelation 17:5), cannot rival this, as Jehovah’s people are “no part of the world” (John 17:16).</p><br><p>Persecution tests this worship, as when Nero burned Christians in 64 CE, yet “they rejoiced because they had been counted worthy” (Acts 5:41). Daniel faced lions for praying, “he kept praying just as he had been doing” (Daniel 6:10), and Jehovah saved him, “no injury was found on him” (Daniel 6:23). True worshipers today stand firm, “endure to the end” (Matthew 24:13), knowing “those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30).</p><br><p><em>“You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth.” — John 4:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Elements of Worship</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s worship includes prayer, “call upon me in the day of distress” (Psalm 50:15); study, “this book of the Law should not depart from your mouth” (Joshua 1:8); and preaching, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). Meetings unite His people, “not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25), as in the first century, “they continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42). Each act honors Jehovah, “offer to God a sacrifice of praise” (Hebrews 13:15).</p><br><p><em>“You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth.” — John 4:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Opposition Overcome</strong></p><br><p>Satan opposes Jehovah’s worship, “the god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah protects His servants, as when He freed Peter from prison, “the angel struck Peter on the side” (Acts 12:7). History shows His deliverance—Israel’s exodus, “Jehovah brought them out” (Exodus 12:51)—and prophecy assures victory, “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17). True worshipers persist, “we must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29).</p><br><p><em>“You must worship Jehovah your God with spirit and truth.” — John 4:24</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Justice</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s justice is perfect, reflecting His nature as “a God of faithfulness, without injustice” (Deuteronomy 32:4). He judges impartially, “Jehovah will by no means leave the guilty unpunished” (Nahum 1:3), yet offers mercy, “he does not desire anyone to be destroyed” (2 Peter 3:9). His justice was evident in the Flood around 2370 BCE, “every living thing was wiped out” (Genesis 7:23), for “the earth was filled with violence” (Genesis 6:11). He destroyed Sodom, “sulfur and fire from Jehovah” (Genesis 19:24), for “their sin has become very grave” (Genesis 18:20). Yet, He spared Rahab for her faith, “Jehovah your God is God” (Joshua 2:11), showing “he will render to each one according to his works” (Romans 2:6). His law to Israel, “you must not pervert justice” (Deuteronomy 16:19), set a standard, and His discipline, “I disciplined them to the proper degree” (Jeremiah 30:11), corrects lovingly. True worshipers trust His justice, “Jehovah is a God of justice” (Isaiah 30:18).</p><br><p>Satan’s world mocks justice, but Jehovah’s judgments prevail, as when He struck 185,000 Assyrians, “they were all dead bodies” (2 Kings 19:35), defending His people. At Armageddon, “the great day of Jehovah” (Zephaniah 1:14), His justice will end wickedness, “the wicked will be no more” (Psalm 37:10), fulfilling His promise, “righteousness will dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“A God of faithfulness, without injustice.” — Deuteronomy 32:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Mercy in Judgment</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s justice includes mercy, “slow to anger and abundant in loyal love” (Exodus 34:6). He forgave Nineveh, “he did not bring the calamity” (Jonah 3:10), and David, “Jehovah has pardoned your sin” (2 Samuel 12:13), when they repented. His ransom through Jesus, “a propitiatory sacrifice” (1 John 2:2), extends mercy, “everlasting life to those who obey him” (Hebrews 5:9). Yet, mercy has limits, “he will not always shield the guilty” (Exodus 34:7), as Ananias learned, “you have lied to God” (Acts 5:4-5).</p><br><p><em>“A God of faithfulness, without injustice.” — Deuteronomy 32:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Application Today</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah calls His people to reflect His justice, “do not pervert justice or show partiality” (Deuteronomy 16:19), and to love mercy, “love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:39). When Israel failed, “Jehovah’s anger blazed” (2 Kings 17:18); today, true worshipers uphold fairness, “the one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18), preparing for “a new earth” where “justice is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“A God of faithfulness, without injustice.” — Deuteronomy 32:4</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Mercy</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s mercy is His compassionate willingness to forgive and restore, as He declares, “I am compassionate” (Exodus 22:27), and “I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked” (Ezekiel 33:11). His mercy shone when He spared Israel despite their rebellion, “for the sake of my name I will hold back my anger” (Isaiah 48:9), and when He sent Jesus, “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son” (John 3:16). Around 1513 BCE, after the golden calf, “Jehovah forgave the people” (Exodus 34:9-10), showing His “abundant loyal love” (Psalm 86:5). He saved Rahab, “you have shown loyal love” (Joshua 2:12-14), and Manasseh, “he humbled himself greatly” (2 Chronicles 33:12-13), proving “his mercy endures forever” (Psalm 136:1). True worshipers seek this mercy, “return to Jehovah your God” (Hosea 14:1), and share it, “become merciful, just as your Father is merciful” (Luke 6:36).</p><br><p>Satan’s lies paint Jehovah as merciless, but His actions refute this—Nineveh’s reprieve, “he felt regret over the calamity” (Jonah 3:10), and the resurrection hope, “all those in the memorial tombs” (John 5:28-29), show His heart. False religion’s hellfire doctrine denies this, but Jehovah’s mercy ensures “death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4).</p><br><p><em>“I am compassionate.” — Exodus 22:27</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Conditions for Mercy</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s mercy requires repentance, “let the wicked leave his way” (Isaiah 55:7), as seen when He spared David, “I have sinned greatly” (2 Samuel 12:13). Unrepentant ones, like Achan, faced death, “Jehovah’s anger blazed” (Joshua 7:1). His mercy extends through Jesus, “a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins” (1 John 2:2), but demands faith, “the one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36).</p><br><p><em>“I am compassionate.” — Exodus 22:27</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Extending Mercy</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah commands His people to show mercy, “you must love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18), as the Samaritan did, “he showed mercy to him” (Luke 10:37). Forgiving others, “forgive men their trespasses” (Matthew 6:14), and preaching, “make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), reflect His mercy, preparing for a world where “mercy triumphs over judgment” (James 2:13).</p><br><p><em>“I am compassionate.” — Exodus 22:27</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Jehovah’s Promises</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s promises are unbreakable, as “not one word of all his good promise failed” (1 Kings 8:56). He vowed a paradise earth, “the righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29), a hope from Eden, “he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18). His covenant with Abraham, “all the families of the ground will be blessed” (Genesis 12:3), was fulfilled through Jesus, “a ransom in exchange for many” (Matthew 20:28). He promised Israel deliverance, “I will take you as my people” (Exodus 6:7), realized at the Red Sea, “Jehovah saved Israel” (Exodus 14:30). His prophecy of Cyrus, “he is my shepherd” (Isaiah 44:28), freed Israel in 537 BCE, “the word of Jehovah was fulfilled” (Ezra 1:1). Today, His Kingdom promise, “it will crush all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44), advances since 1914, urging true worshipers to trust, “my word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11).</p><br><p>Satan challenges these promises, but Jehovah’s record stands—Tyre’s ruin, “a bare rock” (Ezekiel 26:4), and Babylon’s fall, “it will never be inhabited” (Isaiah 13:20), prove His word. False religion denies His promises, but “heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away” (Matthew 24:35).</p><br><p><em>“Not one word of all his good promise failed.” — 1 Kings 8:56</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Historical Fulfillment</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s promises shaped history: Noah’s ark, “Jehovah shut the door” (Genesis 7:16), saved eight; Joshua’s conquest, “not one word failed” (Joshua 21:45), gave Israel Canaan; and Jerusalem’s fall, “the land will be desolate” (Jeremiah 25:11), lasted 70 years. The Dead Sea Scrolls, dated to 200 BCE, confirm His preserved Word, “the word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25).</p><br><p><em>“Not one word of all his good promise failed.” — 1 Kings 8:56</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Future Assurance</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s future promises include Armageddon, “the wicked will be no more” (Psalm 37:10), and resurrection, “those asleep in the dust will wake up” (Daniel 12:2). His Kingdom will bring “a new heavens and a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where “death will be no more” (Revelation 21:4). True worshipers act now, “pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), confident in “Jehovah of armies” (Isaiah 44:6).</p><br><p><em>“Not one word of all his good promise failed.” — 1 Kings 8:56</em></p>

        <p><strong>Jehovah’s Kingdom</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s Kingdom is the divine government that will soon end all human rule and restore the earth to its intended paradise, a promise fulfilled through Jesus Christ, who began ruling as King in 1914, as foretold, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed... it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). This Kingdom’s establishment was marked by “the appointed times of the nations” ending (Luke 21:24), calculated from Jerusalem’s fall in 607 BCE through Daniel’s “seven times” (Daniel 4:25)—2,520 years that pinpoint 1914, when wars, famines, and earthquakes surged, fulfilling Jesus’ words, “Nation will rise against nation... there will be food shortages and earthquakes” (Matthew 24:7-8). Jehovah’s purpose is unshakable, as He declares, “My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please” (Isaiah 46:10), ensuring that this Kingdom will “fill the whole earth” (Daniel 2:35). It comprises 144,000 co-rulers with Christ, “bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:1, 3), while a “great crowd” survives Armageddon to inhabit the earth (Revelation 7:9), a dual hope that reflects Jehovah’s mercy and justice.</p><br><p>Human governments, from Rome’s collapse in 476 CE to today’s nations, have failed to bring peace, but Jehovah’s Kingdom succeeds where they falter, as “your throne, O God, is forever and ever” (Psalm 45:6). Its signs since 1914—global conflicts like World War I, pandemics like the Spanish Flu—confirm its presence, and Jesus’ parable of the wheat and weeds shows it grows amid opposition until “the harvest,” when “the righteous will shine as brightly as the sun” (Matthew 13:39-43). Jehovah’s past interventions, like toppling Babylon in 539 BCE, “the kingdom was given to the Medes and Persians” (Daniel 5:28), preview this Kingdom’s triumph, for “the kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” (Revelation 11:15). True worshipers pray for its full realization, knowing “your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom” (Psalm 145:13).</p><br><p><em>“Your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.” — Psalm 145:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Armageddon</strong></p><br><p>Armageddon is Jehovah’s final war against wickedness, “the battle of the great day of God the Almighty” (Revelation 16:14), a climactic event that follows “the great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning” (Matthew 24:21). It will destroy false religion—“Babylon the Great has fallen” (Revelation 18:2)—and evil governments, as “the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war” but are defeated (Revelation 19:19-21). Jehovah’s power was shown when He drowned Egypt’s army, “not one of them remained” (Exodus 14:28), and Armageddon will be even greater, for “he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God” (Revelation 19:15). Survivors will inherit a cleansed earth, where “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3), fulfilling Jehovah’s promise, “Behold, I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5).</p><br><p><em>“Your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.” — Psalm 145:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>1914</strong></p><br><p>The year 1914 marks a pivotal moment in Bible prophecy, when Jesus Christ was enthroned as King of Jehovah’s Kingdom, ending “the appointed times of the nations” (Luke 21:24), a period of Gentile domination that began with Jerusalem’s destruction by Babylon in 607 BCE. This date is calculated from Daniel’s prophecy of “seven times” (Daniel 4:25), where Nebuchadnezzar’s seven-year madness symbolized 2,520 years (using “a day for a year” from Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:6), stretching from 607 BCE to October 1914. That year saw the outbreak of World War I, an unprecedented conflict that killed millions, alongside famines and the 1918 Spanish Flu, fulfilling Jesus’ words, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another” (Matthew 24:7). Jehovah’s purpose advanced, as “the Son of man came on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory” (Matthew 24:30), not visibly but in authority, a reign confirmed by “your throne is established from long ago” (Psalm 93:2).</p><br><p><em>“Your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.” — Psalm 145:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The King Jesus Christ</strong></p><br><p>Jesus Christ is the appointed King of Jehovah’s Kingdom, enthroned in 1914 to fulfill the prophecy, “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom... it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). As “the faithful and true witness” (Revelation 3:14) and “the firstborn of all creation” (Colossians 1:15), Jesus was chosen by Jehovah to rule, declared at his baptism, “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved” (Matthew 3:17). His earthly life, preaching “the good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 4:23), and his sacrificial death, “he bore our sins in his own body on the stake” (1 Peter 2:24), qualified him to reign, as Jehovah exalted him, “God kindly gave him the name that is above every other name” (Philippians 2:9). Since 1914, Jesus rules from heaven, “he must rule as king until he has put all enemies under his feet” (1 Corinthians 15:25), preparing for Armageddon, where “he treads the winepress of the wrath of God” (Revelation 19:15). True worshipers honor him as King, praying, “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10), and proclaiming his rule, “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p>Satan opposes Jesus’ kingship, tempting him to worship him, “All these things I will give you” (Matthew 4:9), but Jesus remained loyal, “It is Jehovah your God you must worship” (Matthew 4:10). False religion denies his role, but Jehovah’s Word confirms, “The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” (Revelation 11:15). Jesus’ miracles, like raising Lazarus, “he who had been dead came out” (John 11:44), and his resurrection, “the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep” (1 Corinthians 15:20), prove his authority as King, fulfilling Jehovah’s purpose for a paradise earth.</p><br><p><em>“The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” — Revelation 11:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Qualifications for Kingship</strong></p><br><p>Jesus earned his kingship through obedience and sacrifice. He resisted Satan’s temptations, “Get behind me, Satan!” (Matthew 16:23), and fulfilled prophecy, “he was numbered with the transgressors” (Isaiah 53:12). His ransom, “the Son of man came to give his life as a ransom” (Matthew 20:28), opened the way for salvation, “through one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous” (Romans 5:19). Jehovah rewarded his faithfulness, “all authority has been given me in heaven and on earth” (Matthew 28:18), making him the only mediator, “one mediator between God and men” (1 Timothy 2:5).</p><br><p><em>“The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” — Revelation 11:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Future Reign</strong></p><br><p>Jesus’ reign will fully manifest after Armageddon, when “the righteous will shine as brightly as the sun” (Matthew 13:43). He will judge the living and the dead, “he will separate people one from another” (Matthew 25:32), and restore earth, “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). His rule ensures “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24), fulfilling Jehovah’s promise, “I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5). True worshipers submit to him now, “every knee should bend” (Philippians 2:10), preparing for his eternal reign.</p><br><p><em>“The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” — Revelation 11:15</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The 144,000 Co-Rulers</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s Kingdom includes 144,000 co-rulers with Christ, chosen from humanity to serve as “a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will rule as kings over the earth” (Revelation 5:10). These “bought from the earth” (Revelation 14:3) are sealed from “every tribe of the sons of Israel” (Revelation 7:4), a symbolic number representing faithful ones from the first century to the last days. They partake of the Memorial emblems, as Jesus said, “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves” (John 6:53), signifying their heavenly calling, “they will be priests of God and of the Christ” (Revelation 20:6). Their selection began with the apostles, “I have chosen you out of the world” (John 15:19), and continues with anointed ones who endure, “the one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). Jehovah’s justice ensures their number is complete, “the full number of those who are sealed” (Revelation 7:4), to rule with Christ over a paradise earth.</p><br><p>Satan attacks these anointed, “the dragon became enraged with the woman” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah protects them, “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17). False religion claims all go to heaven, but Scripture limits this hope to the 144,000, while the “great crowd” inherits earth (Revelation 7:9). Their role was foreshadowed when Israel’s priests served, “you will become to me a kingdom of priests” (Exodus 19:6), but only the anointed fulfill this in heaven, “they will see his face” (Revelation 22:4).</p><br><p><em>“They will rule as kings over the earth.” — Revelation 5:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Selection Process</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah chooses the 144,000 based on faith and loyalty, as seen in the apostles, “you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones” (Matthew 19:28). They face trials, “counted worthy to be dishonored for the sake of that name” (Acts 5:41), and remain “no part of the world” (John 17:16). Their anointing by holy spirit, “the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit” (Romans 8:16), confirms their calling, a process ongoing since Pentecost 33 CE, when “3,000 were added” (Acts 2:41).</p><br><p><em>“They will rule as kings over the earth.” — Revelation 5:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Role in the Kingdom</strong></p><br><p>The 144,000 will administer Jehovah’s Kingdom, judging with Christ, “they will judge the world” (1 Corinthians 6:2), and aiding the “great crowd,” “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). Their heavenly resurrection, “they were raised in the clouds” (1 Thessalonians 4:17), equips them to serve, “they will rule as kings forever and ever” (Revelation 22:5). True worshipers respect their role, supporting the preaching work, “make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19), which prepares earth for their rule.</p><br><p><em>“They will rule as kings over the earth.” — Revelation 5:10</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Great Crowd</strong></p><br><p>The “great crowd” is a vast multitude from “all nations and tribes and peoples” (Revelation 7:9) who survive Armageddon to live on a paradise earth, fulfilling Jehovah’s promise, “The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29). Unlike the 144,000, they have an earthly hope, “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), and stand “before the throne” by serving Jehovah faithfully, “rendering him sacred service day and night” (Revelation 7:15). They emerge from “the great tribulation” (Revelation 7:14), cleansed by Jesus’ blood, “they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb” (Revelation 7:14). Their faith mirrors Noah’s, who “constructed an ark” (Hebrews 11:7), and Rahab’s, “you have shown loyal love” (Joshua 2:12-14), earning Jehovah’s protection, “he knows how to deliver people of godly devotion” (2 Peter 2:9). True worshipers join this group by preaching, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and obeying, “seek righteousness, seek meekness” (Zephaniah 2:3).</p><br><p>Satan seeks to destroy the great crowd, “the dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah shields them, “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3). False religion’s heaven-for-all doctrine obscures their hope, but Scripture clarifies, “The earth remains forever” (Ecclesiastes 1:4). Their future is secure, “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24), as Jehovah’s Kingdom fulfills His purpose, “he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18).</p><br><p><em>“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” — Psalm 37:29</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Requirements for Survival</strong></p><br><p>The great crowd must exercise faith, “the one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36), and obey, “the one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). They reject false worship, “get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and remain neutral, “my Kingdom is no part of this world” (John 18:36). Their preaching, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), proves their loyalty, as seen in the first century, “they were all scattered, preaching the word” (Acts 8:4).</p><br><p><em>“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” — Psalm 37:29</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Life in Paradise</strong></p><br><p>After Armageddon, the great crowd will “build houses and live in them” (Isaiah 65:21), enjoying “a new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13). They will learn from the 144,000, “they will be priests of God” (Revelation 20:6), and welcome the resurrected, “those asleep in the dust will wake up” (Daniel 12:2). Their eternal life fulfills Jehovah’s promise, “I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5), a hope true worshipers cherish now.</p><br><p><em>“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” — Psalm 37:29</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Last Days</strong></p><br><p>The “last days” began in 1914, when Jesus was enthroned, marking “critical times hard to deal with” (2 Timothy 3:1), as prophesied, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes” (Matthew 24:7). World War I, the 1918 Spanish Flu, and moral decay—“lovers of themselves” (2 Timothy 3:2)—confirm this period, mirroring Noah’s day, “the earth was filled with violence” (Genesis 6:11). Satan’s expulsion from heaven, “the dragon was hurled down to the earth” (Revelation 12:9), intensified woes, “woe to the earth” (Revelation 12:12). Jehovah’s Kingdom advances through preaching, “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth” (Matthew 24:14), a sign of “the end” (Matthew 24:14). True worshipers heed the warning, “The great day of Jehovah is near” (Zephaniah 1:14), seeking “Jehovah while he may be found” (Isaiah 55:6).</p><br><p>Satan blinds humanity to these signs, “the god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s prophecies are clear. The increase in wars, famines, and “earthquakes in one place after another” (Matthew 24:7) since 1914, alongside global preaching, prove “all these things are a beginning of pangs of distress” (Matthew 24:8). False religion ignores this, but Jehovah’s servants proclaim, “Pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19).</p><br><p><em>“The great day of Jehovah is near.” — Zephaniah 1:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Signs of the Times</strong></p><br><p>Jesus outlined last-days signs: wars, “you will hear of wars and reports of wars” (Matthew 24:6); famines, “there will be food shortages” (Matthew 24:7); and moral decline, “the love of the greater number will grow cold” (Matthew 24:12). History confirms this—World War II, the Great Depression’s hunger, and rising crime since 1914 align with “critical times” (2 Timothy 3:1). The preaching work, reaching billions, fulfills “a witness to all the nations” (Matthew 24:14), a unique sign of Jehovah’s purpose.</p><br><p><em>“The great day of Jehovah is near.” — Zephaniah 1:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Preparation for the End</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah calls His servants to prepare, “seek righteousness, seek meekness” (Zephaniah 2:3), by studying, “this book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), and preaching, “make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). The first century saw similar urgency, “they continued devoting themselves to the teaching” (Acts 2:42). Today, true worshipers remain vigilant, “keep on the watch” (Matthew 24:42), trusting “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion” (2 Peter 2:9).</p><br><p><em>“The great day of Jehovah is near.” — Zephaniah 1:14</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Prophetic Evidence</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s prophecies prove His Kingdom’s reality, as “not one of all the good promises Jehovah made to the house of Israel failed” (Joshua 21:45). Daniel’s vision of a statue—gold, silver, bronze, iron, and clay (Daniel 2:31-44)—traced world powers from Babylon to Rome, ending with a divided modern era struck by “the stone” of God’s Kingdom in 1914, “it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms” (Daniel 2:44). Ezekiel’s prophecy, “I will overturn, overturn, overturn it... until he comes whose right it is” (Ezekiel 21:27), pointed to Christ’s enthronement, confirmed by 1914’s war, which shattered empires like Russia and Austria-Hungary. Isaiah named Cyrus 200 years before his birth, “saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd’” (Isaiah 44:28), fulfilled in 539 BCE when he freed Israel, “the word of Jehovah was fulfilled” (Ezra 1:1). These proofs silence doubters, urging true worshipers to “pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), as “the word of Jehovah endures forever” (1 Peter 1:25).</p><br><p>Satan obscures these prophecies, “blinding the minds of the unbelievers” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s Word prevails. Tyre’s ruin, “I will make you a bare rock” (Ezekiel 26:4), fulfilled by Alexander in 332 BCE, and Jerusalem’s 70-year desolation, “until the land had paid off its sabbaths” (2 Chronicles 36:21), show His precision. The Dead Sea Scrolls, dated to 200 BCE, preserve these prophecies, refuting claims of alteration. True worshipers proclaim this evidence, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14).</p><br><p><em>“Not one of all the good promises Jehovah made failed.” — Joshua 21:45</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Historical Confirmations</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s prophecies align with history: Babylon’s fall, “it will never be inhabited” (Isaiah 13:20), remains desolate; the Cyrus Cylinder, from 539 BCE, confirms Israel’s release; and Jerusalem’s fall in 607 BCE, “the land will be desolate” (Jeremiah 25:11), lasted exactly 70 years. The 1914 prophecy, “seven times” (Daniel 4:25), saw World War I erupt, fulfilling “nation will rise against nation” (Matthew 24:7). These events prove “Jehovah is God; there is no other” (Deuteronomy 4:35).</p><br><p><em>“Not one of all the good promises Jehovah made failed.” — Joshua 21:45</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Future Fulfillment</strong></p><br><p>Prophecies yet to be fulfilled include Armageddon, “the battle of the great day” (Revelation 16:14), and the resurrection, “those in the memorial tombs will come out” (John 5:28-29). The Kingdom will bring “a new heavens and a new earth” (2 Peter 3:13), where “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). True worshipers trust this, “heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away” (Matthew 24:35), and prepare by preaching, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19).</p><br><p><em>“Not one of all the good promises Jehovah made failed.” — Joshua 21:45</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>The Great Tribulation</strong></p><br><p>The great tribulation is an unprecedented period of distress preceding Armageddon, “such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now” (Matthew 24:21), when Jehovah’s Kingdom will destroy false religion and human governments. It begins with the fall of “Babylon the Great,” false religion, “in one day her plagues will come” (Revelation 18:8), as “the kings of the earth” turn against her (Revelation 17:16). This triggers global chaos, “nations were in anguish” (Luke 21:25), but Jehovah protects His servants, “seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be that you will be concealed” (Zephaniah 2:3). The tribulation culminates in Armageddon, “the battle of the great day of God the Almighty” (Revelation 16:14), where “the kings of the earth and their armies” are defeated (Revelation 19:19-21). True worshipers prepare by preaching, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), and remaining faithful, “the one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13).</p><br><p>Satan fuels this tribulation, “woe to the earth, because the devil has come down to you” (Revelation 12:12), inciting rebellion against Jehovah’s people, “the dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17). False religion’s collapse exposes its lies, “she has become a dwelling place of demons” (Revelation 18:2), but Jehovah’s Kingdom stands firm, “your Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom” (Psalm 145:13).</p><br><p><em>“The one who endures to the end will be saved.” — Matthew 24:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Stages of the Tribulation</strong></p><br><p>The tribulation unfolds in phases: first, false religion’s destruction, “Babylon the Great has fallen” (Revelation 18:2); then, global distress, “men become faint out of fear” (Luke 21:26); and finally, Armageddon, “he treads the winepress of the wrath” (Revelation 19:15). Jehovah’s past acts, like drowning Pharaoh’s army, “not one of them remained” (Exodus 14:28), foreshadow this sequence. His servants are spared, as Noah was, “Jehovah shut the door” (Genesis 7:16), ensuring “no weapon formed against you will have any success” (Isaiah 54:17).</p><br><p><em>“The one who endures to the end will be saved.” — Matthew 24:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Survival Through Faith</strong></p><br><p>Surviving the tribulation requires faith, “the one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life” (John 3:36), and obedience, “keep on the watch” (Matthew 24:42). The great crowd endures, “they have washed their robes” (Revelation 7:14), by rejecting false worship, “get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4), and preaching, “make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). Jehovah promises protection, “he knows how to deliver people of godly devotion” (2 Peter 2:9), leading to “a new earth” where “righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p><br><p><em>“The one who endures to the end will be saved.” — Matthew 24:13</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Paradise Restored</strong></p><br><p>Jehovah’s Kingdom will restore earth to a paradise, fulfilling His original purpose, “he formed it to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18), where “the righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29). After Armageddon, “the wicked will be no more” (Psalm 37:10), the great crowd and resurrected ones will inhabit a world where “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’” (Isaiah 33:24), and “the wolf will reside with the lamb” (Isaiah 11:6). Jesus’ ransom, “you were bought with a price” (1 Peter 1:18-19), reverses Adam’s curse, “cursed is the ground” (Genesis 3:17), restoring Eden’s perfection, “he planted a garden in Eden” (Genesis 2:8). True worshipers pray for this, “Let your Kingdom come” (Matthew 6:10), and preach its certainty, “this good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). The earth’s design—its oxygen, soil, and water—confirms it as humanity’s home, “the earth remains forever” (Ecclesiastes 1:4).</p><br><p>Satan’s lies, like heaven as the only hope, obscure this truth, “the god of this system of things has blinded the minds” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah’s Word prevails, “the meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5). Past miracles, like Lazarus’ raising, “he who had been dead came out” (John 11:44), preview this restoration. The Kingdom’s rule ensures “they will build houses and live in them” (Isaiah 65:21), a tangible future where “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p><br><p><em>“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.” — Isaiah 11:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Features of Paradise</strong></p><br><p>Paradise will feature peace, “they will not learn war anymore” (Isaiah 2:4); health, “the eyes of the blind will be opened” (Isaiah 35:5); and abundance, “the earth will yield its produce” (Psalm 67:6). The resurrection, “those in the memorial tombs will come out” (John 5:28-29), reunites families, and the 144,000 guide, “they will be priests” (Revelation 20:6). This fulfills Jehovah’s promise, “I am making all things new” (Revelation 21:5), a world without “death or mourning or pain” (Revelation 21:4).</p><br><p><em>“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.” — Isaiah 11:9</em></p>
        <br><p><strong>Human Role</strong></p><br><p>Humans prepare for paradise by faith, “the righteous one will live by reason of faith” (Habakkuk 2:4), and obedience, “keep my commandments and live” (Proverbs 7:2). Preaching, “go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19), and living morally, “be holy, for I am holy” (1 Peter 1:16), align with Jehovah’s purpose. Israel’s blessings for obedience, “Jehovah will bless you” (Deuteronomy 28:2), foreshadow the great crowd’s reward, “the tent of God is with mankind” (Revelation 21:3).</p><br><p><em>“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.” — Isaiah 11:9</em></p>
