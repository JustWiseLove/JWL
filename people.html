                            <p>1. Jehovah - Jehovah is the Almighty God, the Creator of the universe, and the central figure in the Bible. He is the sovereign ruler, the source of all life, and the one who reveals his purpose for humanity through the scriptures. Jehovah is a personal God who desires a relationship with his creation, offering salvation to those who worship him in spirit and truth. He is distinct from all other beings, eternal, and unchanging. Jehovah’s name, represented by the Tetragrammaton (YHWH), appears thousands of times in the original Hebrew scriptures, emphasizing his unique identity. He is the one who sets standards for righteousness, provides guidance through his Word, and will ultimately bring about a new world where his will is done on earth. (Deuteronomy 6:4: "Jehovah our God is one Jehovah."; John 17:3: "This means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.")</p>

                            <p>2. Jesus Christ - Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the first of Jehovah’s creations, and the one through whom all other things were made. He is the promised Messiah, the one who gave his life as a ransom to redeem humanity from sin and death. Jesus is the King of God’s Kingdom, appointed by Jehovah to rule and bring about the restoration of paradise on earth. He is not equal to Jehovah but is subordinate to him, serving as the mediator between God and humans. Jesus’ life on earth demonstrated perfect obedience and love, and his teachings provide the foundation for true worship. He is also the one who will return to execute Jehovah’s judgment at Armageddon and lead humanity into a peaceful new world. (1 Timothy 2:5-6: "For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all—this is what is to be witnessed to in its own due time."; John 1:3: "All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.")</p>

                            <p>3. Adam - Adam was the first human created by Jehovah, formed from the dust of the ground and given life through God’s spirit. He was placed in the Garden of Eden with the prospect of living forever if he remained obedient. Adam was tasked with caring for the earth and naming the animals, reflecting his role as the father of all humanity. However, his disobedience in eating the forbidden fruit brought sin and death into the world, affecting all his descendants. Despite this failure, Adam’s creation highlights Jehovah’s purpose for humans to live in a paradise earth, a purpose that will be fulfilled through Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. (Genesis 2:7: "And Jehovah God went on to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living person."; Romans 5:12: "That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned—.")</p>

                        <!-- Lesson 4 -->

                            </div>
                            <p>4. Noah - Noah was a righteous man who found favor with Jehovah during a time when the earth was filled with violence and wickedness. He was chosen to build an ark to preserve his family and representatives of every animal during the global Flood, which destroyed the ungodly world. Noah’s faith and obedience made him a model of righteousness, and he became the progenitor of all humanity after the Flood. His life demonstrates Jehovah’s justice in dealing with the wicked while providing salvation for those who remain faithful. Noah also received the rainbow as a covenant sign that Jehovah would never again destroy the earth with a flood. (Genesis 6:9: "Noah was a righteous man. He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries. Noah walked with the true God."; Hebrews 11:7: "By faith Noah, after receiving divine warning of things not yet seen, showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household; and through this faith he condemned the world, and he became an heir of the righteousness that results from faith.")</p>

                        <!-- Lesson 5 -->

                            </div>
                            <p>5. Abraham - Abraham, originally named Abram, was a faithful servant of Jehovah who became the father of the nation of Israel. He demonstrated remarkable faith by leaving his homeland at Jehovah’s command and by his willingness to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice when tested. Jehovah made a covenant with Abraham, promising that through his offspring all nations would be blessed—a promise fulfilled through Jesus Christ. Abraham’s life shows the importance of faith and obedience, and he is often called the “father of all those having faith.” His friendship with Jehovah highlights the personal relationship God desires with his servants. (Genesis 12:1-2: "After that Jehovah said to Abram: 'Go out from your land and from your relatives and from the house of your father to the land that I will show you. I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great, and you will become a blessing.'"; Hebrews 11:8: "By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; he went out, although not knowing where he was going.")</p>
                        </div>
                        <!-- Lesson 6 -->

                            </div>
                            <p>6. Moses - Moses was a prophet and leader chosen by Jehovah to deliver the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. He received the Law covenant on Mount Sinai, which included the Ten Commandments, serving as a mediator between Jehovah and the nation of Israel. Moses’ life was marked by humility and faithfulness, though he was not permitted to enter the Promised Land due to an act of disobedience. He is also credited with writing the first five books of the Bible, known as the Pentateuch. Moses’ role underscores Jehovah’s ability to use imperfect humans to accomplish his purpose and the importance of the Law in preparing the way for the Messiah. (Exodus 9:1: "Then Jehovah said to Moses: 'Go to Pharaoh and say to him, “This is what Jehovah says: ‘Send my people away so that they may serve me.’”'"; Deuteronomy 34:10: "But there has never again arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face-to-face.")</p>

                            <p>7. David - David was a shepherd, warrior, and king of Israel, described as a man agreeable to Jehovah’s heart. He was chosen to lead Israel after Saul and established Jerusalem as the center of worship. David’s faith was evident in his defeat of Goliath and his many psalms that express trust in Jehovah. Despite his serious sins, such as his affair with Bath-sheba, David’s repentance and humility made him a model of godly devotion. He was an ancestor of Jesus Christ, and Jehovah made a covenant with him that his throne would be established forever through the Messiah. (1 Samuel 16:13: "So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and the spirit of Jehovah began to empower David from that day forward."; Acts 13:22: "After removing him, he raised up for them David as king, about whom he said, bearing witness: ‘I have found David the son of Jesse a man agreeable to my heart; he will do all the things I desire.’")</p>

                            <p>8. Paul - Paul, originally named Saul, was a Pharisee who persecuted Christians until he was called by Jesus on the road to Damascus. He became a zealous apostle, spreading the good news to the Gentiles and writing 14 books of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Paul’s letters provide deep insights into Christian doctrine, including the role of faith, the resurrection, and the importance of love. He endured numerous hardships, including imprisonment and shipwreck, to preach the message of Christ. His life shows how Jehovah can transform even the most unlikely individuals into powerful instruments for his purpose. (Acts 9:15: "But the Lord said to him: 'Go, because this man is a chosen vessel to me to bear my name to the nations as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.'"; 2 Corinthians 11:23-27: "Are they ministers of Christ? I reply like a madman, I am more outstandingly one: I have done more work, been imprisoned more often, suffered countless beatings, and experienced many near-deaths.")</p>

                            <p>9. Peter - Peter, originally named Simon, was a fisherman whom Jesus called to be a “fisher of men.” He became a prominent apostle, often acting as a spokesman for the group. Peter was given the “keys of the Kingdom,” symbolizing his role in opening the way for both Jews and Gentiles to enter God’s congregation. Despite his impulsive nature and his denial of Jesus during the trial, Peter’s repentance and faith made him a pillar in the early Christian congregation. He wrote two inspired letters and was a key figure in the events of Pentecost. (Matthew 16:18: "Also, I say to you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my congregation, and the gates of the Grave will not overpower it."; Acts 2:14: "But Peter stood up with the Eleven and raised his voice and said to them: 'Men of Judea and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you and listen carefully to my words.'")</p>

                            <p>10. Solomon - Solomon, David’s son, was the third king of Israel, renowned for his wisdom, wealth, and the construction of Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem. Jehovah granted him wisdom after he humbly asked for understanding to judge God’s people. Solomon’s reign was a time of peace and prosperity, and he wrote Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon. However, his later years were marked by disobedience as he married foreign wives who led him into idolatry, showing the dangers of compromising true worship. (1 Kings 3:12: "Look! I will do what you asked. I will give you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has never been anyone like you before, nor will there ever be one after you."; 1 Kings 11:9: "Jehovah became furious at Solomon, because his heart had turned away from Jehovah the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.")</p>

                            <p>11. Isaiah - Isaiah was a prophet in Judah during a time of spiritual decline, serving under four kings. He foretold the coming of the Messiah, providing some of the most detailed prophecies about Jesus’ life and role. Isaiah’s writings also emphasize Jehovah’s sovereignty and the future restoration of his people, including the establishment of a new heavens and a new earth. His book is often quoted in the Christian Greek Scriptures, showing its importance in understanding God’s purpose. Isaiah’s courage in delivering Jehovah’s messages, even in the face of opposition, makes him a model of faithful service. (Isaiah 7:14: "Therefore, Jehovah himself will give you a sign: Look! The young woman will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and she will name him Immanuel."; Isaiah 9:6: "For a child has been born to us, a son has been given to us; and the rulership will rest on his shoulder. His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.")</p>

                            <p>12. John the Baptist - John the Baptist was the forerunner of Jesus, sent to prepare the way for the Messiah by preaching repentance and baptizing in the Jordan River. He was the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth, born miraculously in their old age. John lived a simple life in the wilderness, wearing camel hair and eating locusts and honey, and his bold preaching called the people to turn back to Jehovah. He baptized Jesus, identifying him as the “Lamb of God,” and was later executed by Herod Antipas for condemning his immoral marriage. (Matthew 3:1-2: "In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying: 'Repent, for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.'"; Luke 1:17: "Also, he will go before him with Elijah’s spirit and power, to turn the hearts of fathers to children and the disobedient ones to the practical wisdom of righteous ones, to get ready for Jehovah a prepared people.")</p>

                            <p>13. Mary (Mother of Jesus) - Mary was a young Jewish woman chosen by Jehovah to give birth to Jesus, the Messiah. She was a virgin when the angel Gabriel announced that she would bear a son through the power of holy spirit. Mary’s faith and humility were evident in her willing acceptance of this role, despite the potential for social stigma. She supported Jesus throughout his life, witnessing his ministry and his death on the stake, and was present at Pentecost when the holy spirit was poured out. Mary’s example shows the honor Jehovah gives to those who are faithful and humble. (Luke 1:30-31: "So the angel said to her: 'Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And look! you will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus.'"; Luke 1:38: "Then Mary said: 'Look! Jehovah’s slave girl! May it happen to me according to your declaration.' At that the angel left her.")</p>

                            <p>14. Joseph (Jesus’ Adoptive Father) - Joseph was a carpenter from Nazareth and the adoptive father of Jesus. He was a righteous man who accepted Mary as his wife after learning from an angel that her pregnancy was by holy spirit. Joseph protected his family by fleeing to Egypt to escape Herod’s decree to kill the young boys in Bethlehem. He raised Jesus as his own son, teaching him the trade of carpentry and ensuring he was brought up in the ways of Jehovah. Joseph’s obedience to divine direction and his care for his family highlight his role in Jehovah’s purpose. (Matthew 1:20-21: "But after he had thought these things over, look! Jehovah’s angel appeared to him in a dream, saying: 'Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife home, for what has been conceived in her is by holy spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.'"; Matthew 2:13: "After they had departed, look! Jehovah’s angel appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying: 'Get up, take the young child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the young child to kill him.'")</p>

                            <p>15. Eve - Eve was the first woman, created by Jehovah from one of Adam’s ribs to be his complement and helper. She lived with Adam in the Garden of Eden, where they were given the command not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad. Eve was deceived by the serpent (Satan) and ate the forbidden fruit, then gave some to Adam, leading to their expulsion from Eden and the introduction of sin and death. Despite her role in the fall, Eve is called the “mother of everyone living,” as all humanity descends from her. (Genesis 2:22: "And Jehovah God built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man."; Genesis 3:20: "After this Adam named his wife Eve, because she was to become the mother of everyone living.")</p>

                            <p>16. Daniel - Daniel was a Jewish exile in Babylon who served Jehovah faithfully despite being in a foreign land. He was known for his wisdom, interpreting dreams for kings like Nebuchadnezzar and Darius, and for his unwavering devotion to Jehovah, even when it meant facing death in the lions’ pit. Daniel’s prophecies provide insight into the succession of world powers and the establishment of God’s Kingdom through the Messiah. His life demonstrates the importance of maintaining integrity and trust in Jehovah under pressure. (Daniel 2:19-20: "Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision at night, and Daniel praised the God of the heavens. Daniel said: 'Let the name of God be praised for all eternity, for wisdom and mightiness are his alone.'"; Daniel 6:22: "My God sent his angel and shut the mouth of the lions, and they have not harmed me, for I was found innocent before him; nor have I done any wrong to you, O king.'")</p>

                            <p>17. Elijah - Elijah was a prophet in Israel during a time of widespread Baal worship under King Ahab and Queen Jezebel. He boldly confronted the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel, proving Jehovah’s superiority by calling down fire from heaven. Elijah performed miracles, such as raising a widow’s son from the dead, and was taken to heaven in a fiery chariot. His work prefigures the role of John the Baptist, and he is expected to have a symbolic role in the last days as a restorer of true worship. (1 Kings 18:38-39: "At that the fire of Jehovah fell from above and consumed the burnt offering, the pieces of wood, the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the water in the trench. When all the people saw it, they fell facedown and said: 'Jehovah is the true God! Jehovah is the true God!'"; 2 Kings 2:11: "As they were walking along, speaking as they walked, suddenly a fiery chariot and fiery horses made a separation between the two of them, and Elijah went up to the heavens in a windstorm.")</p>

He performed many miracles, including healing Naaman of leprosy, multiplying a widow’s oil, and raising a child from the dead. Elisha’s ministry focused on showing Jehovah’s power and mercy to the people of Israel, often in contrast to the unfaithfulness of the kings. His life illustrates how Jehovah equips his servants to carry out his will, even in challenging times. (2 Kings 2:9: "As soon as they had gone across, Elijah said to Elisha: 'Ask what you want me to do for you before I am taken from you.' So Elisha said: 'Please, may I receive a double portion of your spirit?'"; 2 Kings 5:14: "So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of the true God, and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a small boy, and he became clean.")</p>

John wrote the Gospel of John, three letters, and the book of Revelation, which he received while exiled on Patmos. His writings emphasize love, truth, and the hope of everlasting life under God’s Kingdom. (John 13:23: "One of the disciples, the one whom Jesus loved, was reclining close to Jesus."; Revelation 1:9: "I John, your brother and a sharer with you in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in association with Jesus, was on the island called Patmos for speaking about God and bearing witness concerning Jesus.")</p>

Known as the “weeping prophet,” he delivered Jehovah’s messages of warning and judgment, calling the people to repent of their idolatry and injustice. Despite facing rejection, imprisonment, and plots against his life, Jeremiah remained faithful, even writing the book of Lamentations to mourn Jerusalem’s destruction. His prophecies also include hope for a new covenant, fulfilled through Jesus Christ. (Jeremiah 1:5: "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I sanctified you. I made you a prophet to the nations."; Jeremiah 31:31: "Look! The days are coming,” declares Jehovah, “when I will make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant.")</p>

He demonstrated faith and courage, leading the conquest of Canaan, including the miraculous fall of Jericho. Joshua’s leadership emphasized the importance of obeying Jehovah’s Law, and he urged the people to “choose for yourselves today whom you will serve.” His life shows how Jehovah supports those who trust in him fully. (Joshua 1:2: "Moses my servant is dead. Now get up, cross the Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the people of Israel."; Joshua 24:15: "Now if it seems bad to you to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve, whether the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling. But as for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah.")</p>

He served as a mediator between Jehovah and the people during a time of transition, anointing both Saul and David as kings. Samuel’s life was marked by integrity and obedience, and he played a key role in turning the people back to true worship after a period of spiritual decline. His example shows the importance of listening to Jehovah’s voice. (1 Samuel 3:10: "Then Jehovah came and stood there, and he called as at the other times: 'Samuel, Samuel!' At that Samuel said: 'Speak, for your servant is listening.'"; 1 Samuel 16:13: "So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and the spirit of Jehovah began to empower David from that day forward.")</p>

                            <p>23. Isaac - Isaac was the son of Abraham and Sarah, born miraculously in their old age as the child of promise through whom Jehovah’s covenant would continue. He willingly submitted to being offered as a sacrifice by Abraham, a test of faith that prefigured Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. Isaac’s life was relatively peaceful, and he passed on the covenant blessings to his son Jacob, showing his role in Jehovah’s purpose for Israel. (Genesis 21:3: "So Abraham named his son who had been born to him, whom Sarah had borne to him, Isaac."; Genesis 22:9: "Finally they reached the place that the true God had indicated to him, and Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac hand and foot and put him on the altar on top of the wood.")</p>

                            <p>24. Jacob - Jacob, Isaac’s son, was the father of the 12 tribes of Israel, whose name was changed to Israel after he wrestled with an angel. Despite his early deceit in obtaining Esau’s birthright and blessing, Jacob grew in faith, receiving Jehovah’s promise to make his offspring numerous. His life, including his 12 sons and his reunion with Joseph in Egypt, shows Jehovah’s ability to work through imperfect humans to fulfill his purpose. (Genesis 32:28: "Then he said: 'Your name will no longer be Jacob but Israel, for you have contended with God and with men and you have at last prevailed.'"; Genesis 35:10: "God said to him: 'Your name is Jacob. Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel will be your name.' So he named him Israel.")</p>

                            <p>25. Joseph (Son of Jacob) - Joseph was Jacob’s favored son, sold into slavery by his jealous brothers but raised by Jehovah to become a ruler in Egypt. His ability to interpret dreams led to his appointment as second-in-command to Pharaoh, where he managed Egypt’s resources during a famine, saving his family and many others. Joseph’s forgiveness of his brothers and his faith in Jehovah’s promises demonstrate his godly character and role in preserving the line of the Messiah. (Genesis 41:41: "Pharaoh further said to Joseph: 'See, I am putting you over all the land of Egypt.'"; Genesis 50:20: "Although you meant to harm me, God intended it to turn out well and to preserve many people alive, as he is doing today.")</p>

She risked her life to approach the king uninvited, revealing a plot by Haman to destroy the Jews. Her courage and faith in Jehovah led to the deliverance of her people, celebrated in the festival of Purim. Esther’s story shows how Jehovah can use individuals in unexpected positions to protect his people. (Esther 4:14: "For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another source, but you and your father’s house will perish. And who knows whether it was for a time like this that you became queen?"; Esther 7:3: "Queen Esther answered: 'If I have found favor with you, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be granted to me as my request, and my people as my petition.'")</p>

She chose to stay with Naomi, saying, “Your people will be my people, and your God my God.” Ruth’s faithfulness led her to marry Boaz, a kinsman-redeemer, and she became the great-grandmother of David, placing her in the lineage of Jesus. Her story highlights the value of loyalty and Jehovah’s care for those who seek him. (Ruth 1:16: "But Ruth said: 'Do not plead with me to abandon you, to turn back from accompanying you; for where you go I will go, and where you spend the night, I will spend the night. Your people will be my people, and your God my God.'"; Ruth 4:17: "The neighbor women gave him a name. They said: 'A son has been born to Naomi.' And they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.")</p>

She encouraged Barak to lead an army against Sisera, the Canaanite commander, and Jehovah gave them victory. Deborah’s leadership and faith in Jehovah’s direction inspired the people, and her song of victory praised Jehovah’s power. Her example shows how Jehovah can use women in significant roles to accomplish his will. (Judges 4:4: "Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time."; Judges 4:14: "Then Deborah said to Barak: 'Get up, for this is the day that Jehovah will give Sisera into your hand. Is Jehovah not going before you?' So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him.")</p>

Initially hesitant, Gideon sought confirmation through signs, such as the fleece test, but grew in faith as Jehovah reduced his army to 300 men to show that the victory was by divine power. Gideon’s obedience led to a miraculous defeat of the Midianites, demonstrating Jehovah’s ability to use the weak to accomplish great things. (Judges 6:14: "Jehovah faced him and said: 'Go with the strength you have, and you will save Israel out of Midian’s hand. Is it not I who send you?'"; Judges 7:7: "Jehovah then said to Gideon: 'I will save you with the 300 men who lapped, and I will give Midian into your hand. Let all the other people go back to their homes.'")</p>

Jehovah gave him superhuman strength, which he used to kill a lion, slay 1,000 Philistines with a donkey’s jawbone, and ultimately destroy a Philistine temple, killing thousands. However, his weakness for foreign women, particularly Delilah, led to his capture and blinding. Samson’s final act of faith resulted in his death but also a great victory for Israel. (Judges 13:5: "For you will conceive and give birth to a son. No razor should touch his head, for the child will be a Nazirite to God from birth, and he will take the lead in saving Israel out of the hand of the Philistines."; Judges 16:30: "Then Samson said: 'Let me die with the Philistines.' He bent forward with all his might, and the house fell on the lords and all the people in it. So he killed more at his death than he had killed during his life.")</p>

Satan challenged Job’s loyalty, and Jehovah allowed him to be tested through the loss of his wealth, children, and health. Despite immense suffering and pressure from his wife and friends to curse God, Job remained faithful, saying, “Jehovah has given, and Jehovah has taken away.” Jehovah restored Job’s fortunes, giving him double what he had lost, showing that those who endure trials with faith will be blessed. (Job 1:8: "Then Jehovah said to Satan: 'Have you taken note of my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad.'"; Job 42:10: "So Jehovah removed Job’s affliction after he had prayed for his companions, and Jehovah gave him double what he had before.")</p>

Despite opposition from enemies like Sanballat and Tobiah, Nehemiah led the people to complete the wall in just 52 days. He also worked to restore true worship by enforcing the Law and ensuring the priests and Levites were supported. Nehemiah’s leadership and reliance on Jehovah show the power of prayer and action in accomplishing God’s will. (Nehemiah 2:17: "Finally I said to them: 'You can see the bad situation we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, so that this disgrace will not continue.'"; Nehemiah 6:15: "So the wall was completed on the 25th day of Elul, in 52 days.")</p>

Ezra also addressed the issue of intermarriage with foreign women, urging the people to repent and separate from false worship. His work laid the foundation for spiritual renewal in Israel, showing the importance of knowing and obeying Jehovah’s Word. (Ezra 7:10: "Ezra had set his heart to consult the Law of Jehovah and to observe it, and to teach its regulations and judgments in Israel."; Ezra 10:11: "Now make confession to Jehovah the God of your forefathers and do his will.

After three days, Jonah was released and obeyed, preaching to Nineveh, which led to their repentance and Jehovah’s mercy.

He spoke for Moses before Pharaoh and later oversaw the priesthood, offering sacrifices for the people. However, Aaron also faltered, such as when he made the golden calf while Moses was receiving the Law, showing the dangers of giving in to pressure. His role highlights the importance of the priesthood in maintaining true worship. (Exodus 4:14: "Then Jehovah’s anger blazed against Moses, and he said: 'What about your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And he is on his way to meet you, and he will rejoice in his heart when he sees you.'"; Exodus 28:1: "You are to have your brother Aaron, along with his sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, come to you from among the Israelites to serve as priests to me—Aaron and his sons.")</p>

                            <p>38. Miriam - Miriam was the sister of Moses and Aaron, who played a key role in saving Moses as a baby by watching over him in the Nile and suggesting their mother as his nurse. She later led the women in song and dance after the crossing of the Red Sea, praising Jehovah for the deliverance. However, Miriam was punished with leprosy for challenging Moses’ authority, showing the need for humility and respect for Jehovah’s appointed leaders. (Exodus 2:7: "Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter: 'Shall I go and call a nursing woman from the Hebrews to nurse the child for you?'"; Numbers 12:10: "When the cloud lifted from the tent, there was Miriam, stricken with leprosy as white as snow. Aaron then looked at Miriam, and she was leprous.")</p>

                            <p>39. Caleb - Caleb was one of the 12 spies sent to scout the Promised Land, and he, along with Joshua, gave a faithful report, urging the people to trust Jehovah and take the land. Despite the majority’s lack of faith, Caleb remained steadfast, and Jehovah promised him an inheritance in the land. At 85 years old, Caleb received Hebron, showing that Jehovah rewards those who remain loyal and courageous. (Numbers 13:30: "Then Caleb tried to calm the people as they stood before Moses by saying: 'Let us go up immediately, for we are surely able to conquer it.'"; Joshua 14:14: "So Hebron belongs to Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite as an inheritance to this day, because he fully followed Jehovah the God of Israel.")</p>

                            <p>40. Rahab - Rahab was a Canaanite prostitute in Jericho who showed faith in Jehovah by hiding the Israelite spies sent by Joshua. She acknowledged Jehovah’s power and asked for her family to be spared when Jericho was destroyed. Rahab and her family were saved, and she later married an Israelite, becoming an ancestor of David and Jesus. Her faith and actions demonstrate that Jehovah accepts those who turn to him, regardless of their past. (Joshua 2:11: "When we heard this, we lost heart, and no one has any courage left because of you, for Jehovah your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth below."; Joshua 6:25: "But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, along with her father’s household and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho, and she lived in Israel to this day.")</p>

He showed kindness by allowing Ruth to glean in his fields and protecting her, and he fulfilled his role as redeemer by marrying her, thus preserving the family line of Elimelech. Their son, Obed, was the grandfather of David, making Boaz an ancestor of Jesus. Boaz’s actions reflect Jehovah’s principles of kindness and justice. (Ruth 2:10: "At that she fell on her face, bowing down to the ground, and said to him: 'How have I found favor in your eyes so that you notice me, when I am a foreigner?'"; Ruth 4:13: "So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife.

He destroyed pagan altars and restored worship at the temple, even reinstating the Passover celebration. When faced with an Assyrian invasion, Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, who miraculously delivered Jerusalem by striking down 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. Jehovah also extended Hezekiah’s life by 15 years after he became deathly ill, showing his mercy to those who seek him. (2 Kings 18:5: "He kept trusting in Jehovah the God of Israel; there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah after him nor among those prior to him."; 2 Kings 20:6: "I will add 15 years to your life, and I will rescue you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David.")</p>

When the book of the Law was found during temple repairs, Josiah tore his garments in distress over the nation’s disobedience and led a sweeping reform, destroying idols and restoring true worship. He also reinstated the Passover, which had not been celebrated to that extent since the days of the judges. Josiah’s zeal for Jehovah’s worship made him a model king. (2 Kings 22:8: "Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary: 'I have found the book of the Law in the house of Jehovah.' So Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, who began to read it."; 2 Kings 23:25: "There was no king like him prior to him, who returned to Jehovah with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, according to all the Law of Moses; nor did another like him rise up after him.")</p>

Timothy served as a representative of Paul, overseeing congregations like the one in Ephesus, and received two inspired letters from Paul. His example shows the value of a good spiritual foundation and the importance of supporting the congregation. (1 Timothy 1:2: "To Timothy, a genuine child in the faith: May you have undeserved kindness, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."; 2 Timothy 1:5: "I recall the faith that is in you without any hypocrisy, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am confident that it is also in you.")</p>

Mark accompanied Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey but left early, though he later proved himself a faithful minister, as Paul acknowledged.
