            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>Loyalty to Jehovah Amid Family Challenges</b></p>
                <p>The Bible, as Jehovah’s inspired Word, is the truth and provides clear guidance on how faithful servants interacted with family members who did not worship Him. "Worldly" family refers to those who follow the desires and values of this world, which lies in Satan’s power (1 John 5:19). The New World Translation shows how God’s people balanced love for family with unwavering devotion to Jehovah.</p>
                <p>In Genesis 13:5-13, Lot, Abraham’s nephew, chose to live near the worldly cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, drawn to their material prospects. Abraham did not follow Lot’s course but remained faithful to Jehovah. Yet, he showed concern for Lot, praying for his safety when God planned to destroy those cities (Genesis 18:23-32). This teaches that while we love family, loyalty to Jehovah comes first.</p>
                <p>Another example is in 1 Samuel 2:12-17, where Eli’s sons, Hophni and Phinehas, acted wickedly despite their priestly roles. Eli failed to correct them, and Jehovah judged them for their sins (1 Samuel 2:29; 4:17, 18). This account shows that even family ties cannot override obedience to God’s standards. The Bible’s truth is clear: we must uphold Jehovah’s ways, even when relatives choose a different path.</p>
                <p><b>Lessons for Today</b></p>
                <p>- <b>Put Jehovah First</b>: Matthew 10:37 says, “Whoever has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me.” Like Abraham, we prioritize God while still showing care.</p>
                <p>- <b>Maintain Standards</b>: Eli’s failure reminds us to uphold Jehovah’s principles in our households.</p>
                <p>- <b>Pray for Family</b>: Abraham’s prayers encourage us to seek Jehovah’s mercy for relatives who do not serve Him.</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 John 5:19 - “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Genesis 13:5-13 - “Lot… pitched his tent near Sodom.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Genesis 18:23-32 - “Abraham… approached and said, ‘Will you… sweep away the righteous with the wicked?’”</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 Samuel 2:12-17 - “The sons of Eli were worthless men.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 Samuel 2:29 - “Why do you keep honoring your sons more than me?”</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 Samuel 4:17, 18 - “Hophni and Phinehas died… Eli… died.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Matthew 10:37 - “Whoever has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me.”</p>

            <summary class="card-header">Loving Family Without Compromise</summary>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>Jesus’ Perfect Example of Love and Truth</b></p>
                <p>The Bible reveals Jesus Christ as the model for how to treat others, including family who did not serve Jehovah. The New World Translation shows Jesus’ compassion, patience, and commitment to truth, always seeking to draw people to his Father. His example guides us in dealing with unbelieving relatives.</p>
                <p>In John 7:3-10, Jesus’ brothers, who did not yet believe in him, urged him to seek public fame by performing miracles. Jesus responded calmly, saying, “My due time has not yet come” (John 7:6). He avoided argument, staying focused on Jehovah’s will. Later, some brothers became disciples (Acts 1:14), showing that Jesus’ patient approach allowed time for change. This encourages us to be gentle with family, trusting our example may influence them.</p>
                <p>In Matthew 12:46-50, when told his mother and brothers sought him, Jesus said, “Whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, that one is my brother and sister and mother” (Matthew 12:50). This emphasizes that spiritual ties with Jehovah’s servants are primary, yet Jesus never treated his physical family harshly. Even on the stake, he ensured his mother, Mary, was cared for (John 19:26, 27), reflecting his love.</p>
                <p>The parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15:11-32 illustrates Jehovah’s mercy toward those who stray. The father welcomed his wayward son back with joy, showing how Jesus viewed those who had not yet returned to God. This teaches us to show kindness, hoping family will accept the truth.</p>
                <p><b>Lessons from Jesus</b></p>
                <p>- <b>Be Compassionate</b>: Luke 6:35 says, “Continue to love your enemies.” Jesus’ kindness teaches us to reflect Jehovah’s love.</p>
                <p>- <b>Stay Focused</b>: Jesus avoided disputes that distracted from his purpose (John 7:8).</p>
                <p>- <b>Hope for Change</b>: The prodigal son parable encourages patience, trusting Jehovah can touch hearts.</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 7:6 - “My due time has not yet come.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Acts 1:14 - “Together with… his brothers.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Matthew 12:50 - “Whoever does the will of my Father… is my brother and sister and mother.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 19:26, 27 - “He said to the disciple: ‘See! Your mother!’”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Luke 15:11-32 - “His father saw him and was moved with pity.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Luke 6:35 - “Continue to love your enemies.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">John 7:8 - “I am not yet going up to this festival.”</p>

            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>Applying God’s Word with Unbelieving Family</b></p>
                <p>The Bible equips us to handle family members who do not serve Jehovah while keeping our faith strong. Below are principles drawn from the New World Translation to guide our actions.</p>
                <p>1. <b>Set a Godly Example</b>: 1 Timothy 4:12 urges, “Be an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.” By living joyfully for Jehovah, we may attract family to the truth, as a shining light (Matthew 5:16).</p>
                <p>2. <b>Guard Your Faith</b>: Psalm 1:1 warns, “Happy is the man who does not walk according to the advice of the wicked.” If relatives promote values contrary to Jehovah’s, we show respect but limit spiritual closeness to protect our faith.</p>
                <p>3. <b>Pray for Strength</b>: Philippians 4:6, 7 promises, “Do not be anxious over anything… and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts.” Prayer helps us stay calm when family ties are strained.</p>
                <p>4. <b>Flee Arguments</b>: 2 Timothy 2:23 advises, “Reject foolish and ignorant debates, knowing they produce fights.” Like Jesus, we respond briefly and kindly, then avoid conflict by changing the topic or withdrawing.</p>
                <p><b>Case Study: Dinah’s Error</b></p>
                <p>Genesis 34:1, 2 recounts how Dinah, Jacob’s daughter, associated with worldly women in Canaan, leading to moral compromise and family distress. This warns us to be cautious about close ties with those who reject Jehovah’s ways, even family. Jacob later protected his household by moving away from danger (Genesis 35:1-5).</p>
                <p class="scripture">1 Timothy 4:12 - “Be an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Matthew 5:16 - “Let your light shine before men.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Psalm 1:1 - “Happy is the man who does not walk according to the advice of the wicked.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Philippians 4:6, 7 - “Do not be anxious over anything… and the peace of God… will guard your hearts.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">2 Timothy 2:23 - “Reject foolish and ignorant debates, knowing they produce fights.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Genesis 34:1, 2 - “Dinah… went out to spend time with the daughters of the land.”</p>
                <p class="scripture">Genesis 35:1-5 - “Jacob said… ‘Let us… go up to Bethel.’”</p>

            <summary class="card-header">Peace Over Strife</summary>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>Keeping Peace Through the Bible’s Wisdom</b></p>
                <p>The Bible, as Jehovah’s inspired Word, provides profound guidance for maintaining peace when dealing with family members who do not serve Him. Arguments with such relatives can test our faith, strain relationships, and disrupt our spiritual joy. Proverbs 15:1 declares, “A mild answer turns away rage, but a harsh word stirs up anger.” By applying this truth, along with other scriptures, we can reflect Jehovah’s peace, protect our spirituality, and honor Him in challenging family interactions. The New World Translation offers clear principles to help us flee from arguments while showing love and maintaining our stand for the truth.</p>
                <p><b>Why Fleeing Arguments Matters</b></p>
                <p>The Bible emphasizes peace and spiritual focus, especially when dealing with those who may not share our faith. Here are key reasons, rooted in scripture, to avoid arguments with worldly family:</p>
                <p>- <b>Preserving Peace Reflects Jehovah’s Qualities</b>: Romans 12:18 urges, “As far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men.” Arguments often escalate, leading to hurt feelings and division. By staying calm, we imitate Jehovah, described as “the God of peace” (Philippians 4:9). Peaceful conduct shows family members the beauty of serving Jehovah, potentially softening their hearts over time.</p>
                <p>- <b>Protecting Our Faith</b>: 2 Timothy 2:23 instructs, “Reject foolish and ignorant debates, knowing they produce fights.” Engaging in heated disputes with relatives who challenge our beliefs can weaken our resolve or plant doubts. The Bible warns that “bad associations spoil useful habits” (1 Corinthians 15:33), so we avoid being drawn into conflicts that could compromise our spirituality.</p>
                <p>- <b>Following Jesus’ Example</b>: Jesus faced opposition but often chose to avoid fruitless arguments. In John 8:59, when enemies sought to stone him, “Jesus hid and went out of the temple.” Likewise, in Luke 4:28-30, when a crowd tried to kill him, he calmly walked away. Jesus’ restraint teaches us to prioritize Jehovah’s purpose over proving a point.</p>
                <p>- <b>Preventing Stumbling</b>: Romans 14:13 advises, “Let us not judge one another any longer, but rather resolve not to put a stumbling block before a brother.” Harsh words in an argument could push a family member further from the truth, making it harder for them to consider Jehovah’s ways. By fleeing conflict, we keep the door open for future opportunities to share our faith.</p>
                <p>- <b>Maintaining Joy</b>: Psalm 16:11 says, “In your presence is abundant joy.” Arguments drain our joy and distract us from serving Jehovah wholeheartedly. By avoiding them, we safeguard the “peace of God that surpasses all understanding” (Philippians 4:7).</p>
                <p><b>Bible Principles for Fleeing Arguments</b></p>
                <p>The New World Translation provides practical wisdom to navigate tense situations with family who do not serve Jehovah. Below are detailed strategies, supported by scriptures, to help us respond with love and restraint:</p>
                <p>1. <b>Listen Patiently and Respectfully</b></p>
                <p>James 1:19 counsels, “Every man must be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.” When a family member raises a controversial topic, such as questioning our beliefs or lifestyle, listening attentively shows respect and helps us understand their perspective. This doesn’t mean agreeing with them but allows us to respond thoughtfully. For example, Proverbs 18:13 warns, “When anyone replies to a matter before he hears it, that is foolishness on his part.” Listening fully prevents rash responses that could spark conflict.</p>
                <p>2. <b>Use Mild and Gracious Speech</b></p>
                <p>Proverbs 25:15 states, “A gentle tongue can break a bone.” Kind, well-chosen words can defuse tension, even when a relative is upset. Colossians 4:6 adds, “Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should answer each person.” A mild reply, such as, “I appreciate your thoughts, but this is what brings me peace,” reflects Jehovah’s love and avoids escalation. The Bible also cautions against harsh speech, as Ecclesiastes 7:9 warns, “Do not be quick to take offense, for the taking of offense rests in the bosom of fools.”</p>
                <p>3. <b>Redirect the Conversation</b></p>
                <p>When discussions veer toward sensitive topics like religion or lifestyle choices, the Bible’s wisdom helps us shift focus. Proverbs 17:14 says, “The beginning of strife is like the opening of a dam; so stop it before a quarrel breaks out.” Redirecting to neutral subjects—such as family memories, shared interests, or practical matters—keeps the interaction positive. For instance, if a sibling criticizes your faith, you might say, “I’m glad we’re together—how’s your new project going?” This approach aligns with 1 Peter 3:11, which urges us to “seek peace and pursue it.”</p>
                <p>4. <b>Withdraw Politely When Necessary</b></p>
                <p>Ecclesiastes 3:7 speaks of “a time to be silent and a time to speak.” If a conversation becomes heated or disrespectful, the Bible supports withdrawing to prevent sinning in anger. Psalm 4:4 advises, “Be agitated, but do not sin.” Politely excusing yourself, such as saying, “I need to step away for a bit, but I’ll catch up with you later,” preserves dignity for all. Jesus modeled this in Matthew 12:14, 15, when he withdrew from Pharisees plotting against him, focusing on his ministry instead of confrontation.</p>
                <p>5. <b>Pray Before and During Interactions</b></p>
                <p>Philippians 4:6 encourages, “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.” Praying before family gatherings prepares us to handle challenges with wisdom. If tension arises, a silent prayer can calm our heart, as Nehemiah did before speaking (Nehemiah 2:4, 5). Jehovah promises to guide us, as Psalm 32:8 says, “I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.”</p>
                <p>6. <b>Prepare Responses in Advance</b></p>
                <p>1 Peter 3:15 urges, “Always be ready to make a defense… with mildness and deep respect.” Anticipating common criticisms from family—such as “Why don’t you celebrate holidays?” or “Why are you so strict?”—allows us to craft concise, kind answers. For example, you might say, “I’ve found peace in following the Bible’s guidance, and I’m happy to explain more another time.” This keeps responses brief and loving, avoiding debates. Proverbs 21:23 reinforces, “The one guarding his mouth and his tongue keeps himself out of trouble.”</p>
                <p>7. <b>Focus on Common Ground</b></p>
                <p>The Bible encourages finding points of agreement where possible. Amos 3:3 asks, “Will two walk together unless they have agreed?” While we differ on spiritual matters, shared values like family loyalty or kindness can bridge gaps. For instance, praising a relative’s generosity or hard work aligns with 1 Thessalonians 5:11, “Keep encouraging one another and building one another up.” This fosters harmony without compromising faith.</p>
                <p><b>Practical Scenarios and Responses</b></p>
                <p>To make these principles actionable, consider the following scenarios, each grounded in Bible counsel:</p>
                <p>- <b>Scenario 1: A Parent Questions Your Faith</b></p>
                <p>During a family dinner, your mother says, “Why do you waste time with that religion instead of enjoying life?” Instead of debating, apply James 1:19 and listen calmly. Respond with Proverbs 15:1 in mind: “I understand you want me to be happy, Mom, and my faith brings me joy. Can we talk about your garden? I love hearing about it.” If she persists, use Ecclesiastes 3:7 and say, “I appreciate your concern—let’s catch up more later,” then step away politely.</p>
                <p>- <b>Scenario 2: A Sibling Mocks Your Beliefs</b></p>
                <p>At a reunion, your brother teases, “You’re missing out because of your rules!” Recall Colossians 4:6 and reply graciously: “I’m grateful for what I believe—it gives me purpose. How’s your new job going?” Redirecting to his interests follows Proverbs 17:14 to stop strife. If mockery continues, apply Psalm 4:4 and excuse yourself: “I need a quick break, but I’ll be back.”</p>
                <p>- <b>Scenario 3: A Relative Challenges Your Choices</b></p>
                <p>Your cousin argues, “Why don’t you join us for the holidays? It’s just family!” Prepare with 1 Peter 3:15 and say, “I love spending time with you, but I follow the Bible’s guidance on celebrations. Maybe we can plan a different get-together?” This respects their feelings while standing firm. If the discussion heats up, pray silently (Philippians 4:6) and redirect: “Speaking of family, how’s your daughter doing at school?”</p>
                <p>- <b>Scenario 4: A Heated Family Gathering</b></p>
                <p>During a holiday event you attend for non-religious reasons, an aunt criticizes, “Your religion makes you distant!” Instead of arguing, use Proverbs 25:15: “I’m sorry you feel that way—I care about you all deeply. Can we share some memories from last summer?” If tensions rise, follow Jesus’ example (John 8:59) and say, “I’ll step out for a bit to clear my head.” Later, pray for her heart to soften (1 Timothy 2:1).</p>
                <p><b>Long-Term Strategies</b></p>
                <p>Fleeing arguments is not just about immediate responses but also about building a pattern of peace. The Bible offers wisdom for sustained harmony:</p>
                <p>- <b>Strengthen Your Faith</b>: Regular prayer and meditation on scriptures like Psalm 119:165—“Abundant peace belongs to those who love your law”—equip you to handle provocations calmly. Reflecting on Jesus’ restraint in Matthew 26:62, 63, when he remained silent before accusers, builds resilience.</p>
                <p>- <b>Set Boundaries with Love</b>: 2 Corinthians 6:14 asks, “What fellowship does light have with darkness?” While we love family, we limit discussions that challenge our faith. For example, politely decline debates by saying, “I’d rather focus on what brings us together.” This aligns with Proverbs 22:3, “The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself.”</p>
                <p>- <b>Show Consistent Kindness</b>: Galatians 6:10 urges, “Let us work what is good toward all.” Small acts—like helping a relative with chores or sending a thoughtful message—build trust without compromising beliefs. Over time, this may reduce tensions, as Proverbs 16:7 says, “When Jehovah is pleased with a man’s ways, he causes even his enemies to be at peace with him.”</p>
                <p>- <b>Trust Jehovah’s Guidance</b>: Proverbs 3:5, 6 promises, “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart… and he will make your paths straight.” When family interactions are complex, rely on God to show the way. Like Joseph, who maintained peace despite his brothers’ past wrongs (Genesis 45:4-8), we can forgive and focus on Jehovah’s purpose.</p>
                <p><b>Encouragement from the Bible</b></p>
                <p>Fleeing arguments requires courage and faith, but Jehovah supports us. Isaiah 26:3 assures, “You will safeguard in perfect peace the one whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts in you.” By applying Bible principles, we avoid strife and reflect God’s wisdom. Jesus’ words in John 16:33 remind us, “In the world you will have tribulation, but take courage! I have conquered the world.” With Jehovah’s help, we can conquer challenges with peace and love.</p>
                <p>Even when family members provoke us, 1 Peter 2:21 encourages, “To this course you were called, because even Christ suffered for you, leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely.” Jesus faced rejection, yet he remained mild (1 Peter 2:23). By imitating him, we honor Jehovah and keep our hearts at peace.</p>

            <summary class="card-header">Wisdom - Foolishness</summary>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Wisdom:</b></p>
                <p>Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge in a way that pleases Jehovah. True wisdom begins with a reverent fear of God and leads to right decisions, clean conduct, and a meaningful life. Jehovah gives wisdom to those who ask with faith and seek his guidance in the Scriptures.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.” (Proverbs 9:10)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Wisdom is the most important thing, so acquire wisdom.” (Proverbs 4:7)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God… and it will be given him.” (James 1:5)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Wisdom:</b></p>
                <p>Wisdom protects us from spiritual danger and helps us live in harmony with Jehovah’s principles. It strengthens our faith, improves our choices, and helps us lead others in a good way. Wise people build strong relationships and walk securely in Jehovah’s favor.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Happy is the man who finds wisdom… It is more valuable than corals; nothing you desire can compare to it.” (Proverbs 3:13, 15)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil.” (Proverbs 14:16)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The wisdom from above is… first of all pure, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey.” (James 3:17)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Foolishness:</b></p>
                <p>Foolishness in the Bible isn’t just about lacking knowledge—it often refers to ignoring Jehovah’s guidance and doing what is right in one’s own eyes. The foolish person acts without thought of consequences or respect for God. Such thinking is spiritually dangerous.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The fool says in his heart: ‘There is no Jehovah.’” (Psalm 14:1)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Fools despise wisdom and discipline.” (Proverbs 1:7)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The heart of the wise one leads him in the right way, but the heart of the stupid one leads him in the wrong way.” (Ecclesiastes 10:2)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Foolishness:</b></p>
                <p>Foolishness can lead to sin, regret, and even spiritual ruin. It blinds a person to Jehovah’s loving direction and often results in harm to themselves and others. Jehovah encourages us to avoid the path of the foolish and walk with the wise instead.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The wise one fears and turns away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.” (Proverbs 14:16)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“A fool gives vent to all his feelings, but the wise one remains calm.” (Proverbs 29:11)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The one walking with the wise will become wise, but the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.” (Proverbs 13:20)</p>

            <summary class="card-header">Holiness - Impurity</summary>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Holiness:</b></p>
                <p>Holiness means being clean, set apart, and loyal to Jehovah. He is the ultimate example of holiness and calls his people to reflect this quality in their lives. Being holy involves avoiding moral uncleanness, staying spiritually clean, and keeping close to Jehovah.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“You must be holy, because I am holy.” (1 Peter 1:16)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Pursue peace with all people and the sanctification [holiness] without which no man will see the Lord.” (Hebrews 12:14)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“This is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality.” (1 Thessalonians 4:3)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Holiness:</b></p>
                <p>Holiness helps us stay close to Jehovah and reflects our deep respect for him. It protects us from harmful influences and allows us to serve him acceptably. Those who are holy will be welcomed into his clean new world, where nothing defiled will exist.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Happy are those who are pure in heart, since they will see God.” (Matthew 5:8)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” (2 Corinthians 7:1)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is near to all those calling on him… in trueness.” (Psalm 145:18)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Impurity:</b></p>
                <p>Impurity includes immoral thoughts, speech, or actions. It makes a person unclean before God and pushes them away from his favor. The Bible strongly warns against uncleanness and lists it among the behaviors that will prevent people from inheriting God’s Kingdom.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“God gave them over to uncleanness in the desires of their hearts.” (Romans 1:24)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Let sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness… not even be mentioned among you.” (Ephesians 5:3)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The works of the flesh are… sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct… those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.” (Galatians 5:19, 21)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Impurity:</b></p>
                <p>Impurity stains our conscience and can damage our relationship with Jehovah. It invites pain, guilt, and consequences. Jehovah lovingly disciplines his people to keep them clean, because he wants them to enjoy a clean conscience and a hopeful future.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Cleanse your hearts, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you indecisive ones.” (James 4:8)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor.” (1 Thessalonians 4:4)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Flee from sexual immorality! Every other sin… is outside his body, but whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body.” (1 Corinthians 6:18)</p>

            <summary class="card-header">Gratitude - Ingratitude</summary>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Gratitude:</b></p>
                <p>Gratitude is a sign of humility and appreciation. Jehovah loves when we express thanks for his blessings—both big and small. Jesus often thanked his Father, and we’re encouraged to follow his example by showing thankfulness in our prayers and actions.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good; his loyal love endures forever.” (Psalm 107:1)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“In everything give thanks. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus.” (1 Thessalonians 5:18)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Whatever you are doing… do it in the name of the Lord Jesus, thanking God the Father through him.” (Colossians 3:17)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Gratitude:</b></p>
                <p>Gratitude helps us see how much Jehovah has already done for us. It keeps us joyful and content even during trials. When we’re grateful, we’re less likely to complain or focus on what we lack. It strengthens our relationship with Jehovah and draws us closer to others.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Do not be anxious over anything… but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.” (Philippians 4:6)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Let the peace of the Christ rule in your hearts… and show yourselves thankful.” (Colossians 3:15)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Offer thanksgiving as your sacrifice to God.” (Psalm 50:14)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Ingratitude:</b></p>
                <p>Ingratitude reflects a lack of appreciation for Jehovah’s kindness. It’s often linked with selfishness and arrogance. The Bible warns that people in the last days would be “unthankful,” showing how serious it is in Jehovah’s eyes.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“People will be… unthankful, disloyal.” (2 Timothy 3:2)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him.” (Romans 1:21)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“You gave them a king, but in your indignation; you took him away, but in your fury.” (Hosea 13:11 – shows consequences of forgetting Jehovah’s goodness)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Ingratitude:</b></p>
                <p>Ingratitude can make us blind to Jehovah’s blessings. It leads to complaining, greed, and discontentment. Failing to thank Jehovah weakens our spirituality and can even cause us to drift away from him. A thankful heart, however, helps us remain faithful and joyful.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“How often they rebelled against him… They forgot his deeds and the wonderful works he had shown them.” (Psalm 78:40-42)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Guard against every sort of greed, because even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.” (Luke 12:15)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“They forgot God their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt.” (Psalm 106:21)</p>

            <summary class="card-header">Forgiveness - Resentment</summary>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Forgiveness:</b></p>
                <p>Forgiveness is a beautiful expression of love and mercy. Jehovah is the perfect example—he is “ready to forgive” those who repent. He also commands us to forgive others from the heart. True forgiveness brings peace and keeps bitterness out of our lives.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is merciful and compassionate… He will not always find fault, nor will he stay angry forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins.” (Psalm 103:8-10)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely.” (Colossians 3:13)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.” (Matthew 6:14)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Forgiveness:</b></p>
                <p>When we forgive, we imitate Jehovah. Forgiveness frees us from anger and helps relationships heal. It also keeps us in Jehovah’s favor, since he will only forgive us if we forgive others. Forgiveness shows strength—not weakness—and brings peace of mind.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Love covers over a multitude of sins.” (1 Peter 4:8)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered.” (Psalm 32:1)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.” (Colossians 3:13)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Resentment:</b></p>
                <p>Resentment is holding onto anger or bitterness, especially after being wronged. It poisons the heart and leads to hatred, division, and even revenge. The Bible warns that resentment is harmful and can separate us from God’s spirit.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Let go of anger and abandon rage; do not become upset and turn to doing evil.” (Psalm 37:8)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Do not hate your brother in your heart.” (Leviticus 19:17)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Be wrathful, yet do not sin… Let the sun not set while you are still angry.” (Ephesians 4:26)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Resentment:</b></p>
                <p>Resentment keeps us from moving forward. It robs us of peace, damages our relationships, and makes us spiritually weak. Jehovah does not hold grudges—and neither should we. Releasing resentment allows us to be truly free and spiritually healthy.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“All bitterness, anger, wrath, shouting, and slander must be removed from you, along with all badness.” (Ephesians 4:31)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“He who cannot forgive others destroys the bridge over which he himself must pass.” (Matthew 18:33, illustration of the unforgiving slave)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit.” (2 Corinthians 7:1)</p>

            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Loyalty:</b></p>
                <p>Loyalty is a deep, faithful love that does not change, even in hard times. Jehovah is the perfect example of loyalty—he remains true to his promises and faithful to those who love him. In return, he expects his people to stay loyal to him, his Son, and one another.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Your loyal love, O Jehovah, reaches to the heavens.” (Psalm 36:5)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” (Revelation 2:10)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Whoever remains loyal in a minor matter is also loyal in much.” (Luke 16:10)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Loyalty:</b></p>
                <p>Being loyal shows that we love Jehovah and trust him. It helps us stay firm during trials, support our spiritual family, and resist pressures from the world. Loyal friends are rare and precious, and Jehovah treasures loyal hearts.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The eyes of Jehovah are on the faithful of the earth.” (Psalm 101:6)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“A true friend shows love at all times and is a brother who is born for times of distress.” (Proverbs 17:17)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Love Jehovah your God with all your heart… and be loyal to him.” (Deuteronomy 30:20)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Betrayal:</b></p>
                <p>Betrayal breaks trust and causes deep pain. It shows selfishness and disloyalty, often for personal gain. Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus with a kiss—a tragic example of how far betrayal can go. The Bible clearly warns against this dangerous trait.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Even the man at peace with me, one whom I trusted… has turned against me.” (Psalm 41:9)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed!” (Mark 14:21)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“A man lacking good sense betrays confidence.” (Proverbs 11:13)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Betrayal:</b></p>
                <p>Betrayal brings shame and regret, and it can destroy relationships permanently. Jehovah values loyalty, not people who switch sides or act treacherously. We should never imitate Satan, the ultimate betrayer of God’s trust.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Traitors… have nothing to do with them.” (2 Timothy 3:4, 5)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The one who slanders his neighbor is stupid.” (Proverbs 11:12)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Jehovah detests a person who causes division among brothers.” (Proverbs 6:19)</p>

            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Obedience:</b></p>
                <p>Obedience is highly valued by Jehovah. It shows respect for his authority and love for his guidance. Even Jesus “learned obedience” during his time on earth. Obeying Jehovah leads to peace, protection, and blessings.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“To obey is better than a sacrifice.” (1 Samuel 15:22)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome.” (1 John 5:3)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Become doers of the word, and not hearers only.” (James 1:22)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Obedience:</b></p>
                <p>Obedience leads to life. When we follow Jehovah’s instructions, we show trust in his wisdom. It also keeps us safe from spiritual harm. Obedience helps us grow close to Jehovah and prepares us for future blessings in his Kingdom.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Keep following the course of obedience to him, and cling to him, for he is your life.” (Deuteronomy 30:20)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“If you listen to my commandments… I will give the rain for your land at its proper time.” (Deuteronomy 11:13-14)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The obedient one will eat the good things of the land.” (Isaiah 1:19)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Disobedience:</b></p>
                <p>Disobedience is rebellion against God’s authority. It began with Satan and led to the fall of Adam and Eve. The Bible warns that those who ignore Jehovah’s laws will not receive his favor. Disobedience brings sorrow, disorder, and ultimately destruction.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“They refused to listen… and they turned a stubborn shoulder.” (Zechariah 7:11)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“God considers vengeance on those who do not obey.” (2 Thessalonians 1:8)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The one who disregards this is disregarding, not man, but God.” (1 Thessalonians 4:8)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Disobedience:</b></p>
                <p>Disobedience leads us away from Jehovah’s protection. It breaks our relationship with him and opens the door to sin. Those who keep ignoring his direction will face his judgment. That’s why cultivating a spirit of obedience is vital for our spiritual survival.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“By your stubbornness… you are storing up wrath for yourself.” (Romans 2:5)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“They stumble because they are disobedient to the word.” (1 Peter 2:8)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Do not be stiff-necked any longer, for Jehovah your God is the God of gods.” (Deuteronomy 10:16-17)</p>

                <p>Self-control is a fruit of God’s spirit. It means having the strength to resist wrong desires, control our emotions, and make wise decisions. Jehovah and Jesus both show perfect self-control. Christians are encouraged to train themselves to think clearly and act with discipline.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“God gave us… power and self-control.” (2 Timothy 1:7)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Like a city broken through and left without a wall is the man who cannot control his temper.” (Proverbs 25:28)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise person keeps it under control.” (Proverbs 29:11)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Self-Control:</b></p>
                <p>Having self-control protects us from harmful choices and keeps us close to Jehovah. It helps us avoid arguments, immoral acts, and regretful words. With self-control, we can resist temptation and remain calm under pressure.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Train yourself with godly devotion.” (1 Timothy 4:7)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Keep your senses, be watchful! Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion.” (1 Peter 5:8)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been carried out, brings forth death.” (James 1:14-15)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Recklessness:</b></p>
                <p>Recklessness is acting without thinking or care for consequences. It includes doing things impulsively, speaking without thought, or chasing selfish desires. The Bible links recklessness with foolishness and pride.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.” (Proverbs 14:16)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The one who guards his mouth protects his life, but the one who talks too much will come to ruin.” (Proverbs 13:3)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“He who hurries to be rich will not remain innocent.” (Proverbs 28:20)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Recklessness:</b></p>
                <p>Recklessness can lead to serious harm—for us and others. It causes bad decisions, damaged reputations, and spiritual danger. Jehovah wants us to be thoughtful and wise, not impulsive or careless. Avoiding reckless actions helps us stay faithful.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“And I have seen how much effort and skillful work spring from rivalry between people; this too is futility, a chasing after the wind.” (Ecclesiastes 4:4)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself, but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.” (Proverbs 22:3)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“A wise person acts with knowledge, but the fool exposes his stupidity.” (Proverbs 13:16)</p>

            <summary class="card-header">Honesty - Deceit</summary>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Honesty:</b></p>
                <p>Honesty is a core part of Jehovah’s standards. He is “a God of truth,” and he expects his servants to speak truthfully and act with integrity. Honesty builds trust, keeps our conscience clean, and brings honor to Jehovah’s name.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Do not lie to one another. Strip off the old personality with its practices,” (Col. 3:9)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Each of you must speak truthfully with his neighbor.” (Ephesians 4:25)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Jehovah detests a lying tongue, but he delights in those dealing faithfully.” (Proverbs 12:22)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Honesty:</b></p>
                <p>Honesty protects us from guilt and regret. It helps us maintain strong relationships and reflect Jehovah’s qualities. Even when it’s difficult, being honest shows spiritual maturity and earns the respect of others. It helps others trust us and the message we share.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“We trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” (Hebrews 13:18)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Conduct yourselves honestly among the nations.” (1 Peter 2:12)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Who may be a guest in your tent?… The one who walks faultlessly, practices what is right, and speaks the truth in his heart.” (Psalm 15:1-2)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Deceit:</b></p>
                <p>Deceit, or lying, is the opposite of Jehovah’s truth. Satan is the “father of the lie” (John 8:44), and lies always lead to trouble and harm. Jehovah hates falsehood and will not allow liars to remain among his people.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“You must not steal, you must not deceive, and you must not lie to one another.” (Leviticus 19:11)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The one hiding hatred has lying lips, and whoever spreads slander is stupid.” (Proverbs 10:18)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Outside are the dogs… and all those who love and practice lying.” (Revelation 22:15)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Deceit:</b></p>
                <p>Lies damage trust, destroy friendships, and can even cost us our relationship with Jehovah. A dishonest life leads to spiritual ruin. That’s why the Bible tells us to “safeguard our lips” and avoid deception in all things.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“A false witness will not go unpunished, and the one who lies with every breath will perish.” (Proverbs 19:9)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (John 8:32)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Put away lies; speak truth each one with his neighbor.” (Zechariah 8:16)</p>

            <summary class="card-header">Peace - Conflict</summary>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Peace:</b></p>
                <p>Peace is one of the beautiful qualities that come from Jehovah. True peace means more than just the absence of fighting—it includes harmony, calmness, and unity with others and with God. Jehovah is called the “God of peace,” and he wants his people to pursue peace in every part of their lives.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Jehovah will bless his people with peace.” (Psalm 29:11)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“If possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men.” (Romans 12:18)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Happy are the peacemakers, since they will be called sons of God.” (Matthew 5:9)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Peace:</b></p>
                <p>Peace allows us to live calmly, make wise choices, and stay close to Jehovah. It helps us stay united with our Christian brothers and sisters. When we act as peacemakers, we imitate Jehovah and help create a peaceful atmosphere in the congregation and in our families.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that build one another up.” (Romans 14:19)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Clothe yourselves with… peace.” (Colossians 3:12, 15)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Those who love your law enjoy abundant peace.” (Psalm 119:165)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Conflict:</b></p>
                <p>Conflict often comes from pride, selfishness, and lack of love. It leads to division and harm. The Bible shows that stirring up arguments and fights is a sign of spiritual weakness. Jehovah does not approve of those who cause strife.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Hatred stirs up conflicts, but love covers over all transgressions.” (Proverbs 10:12)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Where there are jealousy and contentiousness, there will also be disorder and every vile thing.” (James 3:16)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“A man given to anger stirs up strife.” (Proverbs 29:22)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Conflict:</b></p>
                <p>Conflict destroys relationships, breaks down unity, and drives away Jehovah’s spirit. If we allow conflict to grow in our hearts, it can damage our spiritual health. Jehovah wants us to turn away from arguing and be quick to forgive and make peace.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Stop being quarrelsome… be gentle toward all.” (2 Timothy 2:24)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Let all bitterness and anger… be removed from you.” (Ephesians 4:31)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Anyone loving a quarrel loves transgression.” (Proverbs 17:19)</p>

            <summary class="card-header">Patience - Impatience</summary>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Patience:</b></p>
                <p>Patience is a key quality for true Christians. It means calmly enduring difficult situations without giving in to anger or frustration. Jehovah is described as patient, giving people time to change and respond to his guidance. When we are patient, we reflect his love and mercy.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is compassionate and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love.” (Psalm 103:8)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Clothe yourselves with… patience.” (Colossians 3:12)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The end of a matter is better than its beginning; better to be patient than to be haughty in spirit.” (Ecclesiastes 7:8)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Patience:</b></p>
                <p>Patience helps us endure trials, get along with others, and wait for Jehovah’s promises. It protects us from saying or doing things we later regret. Developing patience helps us become mature Christians who are better equipped to face tests of faith.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“By your endurance you will preserve your lives.” (Luke 21:19)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Let endurance complete its work, so that you may be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything.” (James 1:4)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Love is patient and kind.” (1 Corinthians 13:4)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Impatience:</b></p>
                <p>Impatience often leads to harsh speech, rash actions, and a lack of self-control. It can show a lack of trust in Jehovah’s timing. The Bible warns that impatient people are more likely to fall into anger or discouragement, which can harm their spiritual progress.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Do not be quick to take offense, for the taking of offense lodges in the bosom of fools.” (Ecclesiastes 7:9)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“An impatient man stirs up strife.” (Proverbs 15:18)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“A fool gives vent to all his feelings, but the wise one calmly keeps them in check.” (Proverbs 29:11)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Impatience:</b></p>
                <p>Impatience can make us act without wisdom or love. It can damage relationships and push us away from Jehovah’s ways. When we give in to impatience, we stop waiting on Jehovah and may try to take matters into our own hands.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good… Wait eagerly for Jehovah, and he will rescue you.” (Psalm 37:3, 34)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out.” (Galatians 6:9)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The one who trusts in Jehovah will possess the land.” (Psalm 37:9)</p>

            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Kindness:</b></p>
                <p>Kindness is a quality that reflects Jehovah’s personality. It involves showing compassion, gentleness, and care for others, even when it’s not required. Jehovah expects his servants to be kind in speech and action, treating others with dignity and respect.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you.” (Ephesians 4:32)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“But the fruitage of the spirit is… kindness.” (Galatians 5:22)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is righteous in all his ways and loyal in all his works. Jehovah is near to all those calling on him… He satisfies the desire of those who fear him.” (Psalm 145:17-19)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Kindness:</b></p>
                <p>Kindness softens hearts, promotes peace, and strengthens the congregation. It draws others to the truth and shows that we are imitating Jehovah and Christ. When we are kind, even in difficult situations, we become a powerful example of true Christian love.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“A kind man benefits himself, but a cruel man brings trouble on himself.” (Proverbs 11:17)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Clothe yourselves with… kindness.” (Colossians 3:12)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Always treat others as you would like them to treat you.” (Matthew 7:12)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Cruelty:</b></p>
                <p>Cruelty is the opposite of Jehovah’s loving personality. It involves harshness, coldness, and intentional harm. The Bible shows that cruelty reflects a lack of mercy and love, and it causes pain to others. Jehovah disapproves of those who act with cruelty or violence.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“They sharpen their tongue like a sword; they aim their cruel words like arrows.” (Psalm 64:3)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Jehovah examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one; He hates anyone who loves violence.” (Psalm 11:5)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The merciful one is kind to his own soul, but the cruel person brings trouble on himself.” (Proverbs 11:17)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Cruelty:</b></p>
                <p>Cruelty harms our relationships and damages our conscience. It makes us unlike Jehovah, who is tender and compassionate. Cruel actions and speech push others away and can destroy unity in the congregation. We must reject cruelty in all its forms to reflect God’s love.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Remove abusive speech from your mouth.” (Colossians 3:8)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be removed from among you, along with all badness.” (Ephesians 4:31)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.” (Matthew 5:7)</p>

            <summary class="card-header">Humility - Pride</summary>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Humility:</b></p>
                <p>Humility is a precious quality that Jehovah loves. A humble person recognizes their need for God, does not boast, and treats others with respect. Humility allows us to accept correction, follow direction, and give glory to Jehovah instead of ourselves.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is high, but he takes note of the humble.” (Psalm 138:6)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“He has told you, O man, what is good. And what is Jehovah requiring of you? Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty, and to walk modestly with your God!” (Micah 6:8)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Humble yourselves in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will exalt you.” (James 4:10)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Humility:</b></p>
                <p>Humility helps us grow spiritually and maintain peace with others. It keeps us from becoming self-important or hard to work with. Jehovah blesses those who are humble, and Jesus himself set the perfect example of humility that we should follow.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“All of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble.” (1 Peter 5:5)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for yourselves.” (Matthew 11:29)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.” (Matthew 23:12)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Pride:</b></p>
                <p>Pride is dangerous and leads to spiritual downfall. A proud person often relies on themselves rather than Jehovah, and may look down on others. The Bible repeatedly warns that pride leads to destruction and keeps people from recognizing their need for God.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Pride is before a crash, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.” (Proverbs 16:18)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Jehovah detests everyone who is arrogant.” (Proverbs 16:5)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“I will put an end to the pride of the mighty, and their sanctuaries will be profaned.” (Ezekiel 7:24)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Pride:</b></p>
                <p>Pride makes us unapproachable, unteachable, and distant from Jehovah. It can cause arguments, block spiritual growth, and lead to sin. Avoiding pride keeps us close to Jehovah and helps us maintain good relationships in the congregation.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“God opposes the haughty ones but gives undeserved kindness to the humble.” (James 4:6)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with humility consider others superior to you.” (Philippians 2:3)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Let the one who boasts, boast in Jehovah.” (1 Corinthians 1:31)</p>

            <summary class="card-header">Faith - Doubt</summary>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Faith:</b></p>
                <p>Faith is essential for pleasing Jehovah. It means trusting fully in God even when we don’t see the outcome. True faith is not just belief—it’s proven by our actions. The Bible praises faithful men and women who obeyed Jehovah despite trials and uncertainty.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Moreover, without faith it is impossible to please God well, for whoever approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” (Hebrews 11:6)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.” (Hebrews 11:1)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Indeed, we live by faith, not by sight.” (2 Corinthians 5:7)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Faith:</b></p>
                <p>Faith keeps us strong during hard times and helps us stay close to Jehovah. It gives us courage, peace, and endurance. When we have faith, we are not shaken by doubts or fear, and we can confidently rely on Jehovah’s promises.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding.” (Proverbs 3:5)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“For we are saved through faith, and this not because of ourselves, it is God’s gift.” (Ephesians 2:8)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Fight the fine fight of the faith; get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called.” (1 Timothy 6:12)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Doubt:</b></p>
                <p>Doubt can weaken our relationship with Jehovah and cause us to hesitate when we need to act with trust. The Bible shows that those who doubt are unstable and can be easily misled. Doubt is the opposite of relying on Jehovah’s wisdom.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“But let him keep asking in faith, not doubting at all, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about.” (James 1:6)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The one who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not out of faith. For whatever is not out of faith is sin.” (Romans 14:23)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“You of little faith, why did you give way to doubt?” (Matthew 14:31 – Jesus to Peter when he began to sink)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Doubt:</b></p>
                <p>Doubt robs us of peace and confidence in Jehovah. It can lead us to rely on ourselves instead of God and may cause us to shrink back when we should move forward. Removing doubt helps us grow stronger in faith and please Jehovah more fully.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“If anyone shrinks back, I have no pleasure in him.” (Hebrews 10:38)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Trust in Jehovah forever, for Jah Jehovah is the eternal Rock.” (Isaiah 26:4)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Do not be anxious over anything… let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God… will guard your hearts and your mental powers.” (Philippians 4:6-7)</p>

                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Love:</b></p>
                <p>Love is the foundation of true worship and the most important quality we can show. Jehovah himself is described as love, and everything he does is motivated by it. The Bible makes it clear that love should guide all our thoughts, actions, and relationships.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in union with God and God remains in union with him.” (1 John 4:16)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. The second, like it, is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’” (Matthew 22:37-39)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Little children, let us love, not in word or with the tongue, but in deed and truth.” (1 John 3:18)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Love:</b></p>
                <p>Love shows we truly follow Jesus and helps us stay united with others. Without love, our faith is meaningless. Love motivates us to be kind, forgiving, and peaceable. It strengthens the congregation and reflects Jehovah’s own qualities.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“By this all will know that you are my disciples—if you have love among yourselves.” (John 13:35)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Above all things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.” (Colossians 3:14)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a sounding piece of brass… and if I have all the faith so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.” (1 Corinthians 13:1-2)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Hate:</b></p>
                <p>Hate is a harmful quality that leads to division, cruelty, and even spiritual ruin. It shows a lack of love and can damage relationships, the congregation, and our standing with Jehovah. The Bible strongly warns against hatred.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has everlasting life remaining in him.” (1 John 3:15)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen… hatred, strife, jealousy… those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.” (Galatians 5:19-21)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in the darkness.” (1 John 2:9)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Hate:</b></p>
                <p>Hating others blocks our relationship with Jehovah. It makes us spiritually blind and can lead to cruel actions. Jehovah himself hates unjust hatred, and if we hold onto it, we are not imitating him. Replacing hate with love protects our hearts and brings peace.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Anyone who does not love has not come to know God, because God is love.” (1 John 4:8)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“There are six things that Jehovah hates… a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood.” (Proverbs 6:16-17)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“He who hates his brother is in the darkness… and he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.” (1 John 2:11)</p>

            <summary class="card-header">Diligence - Laziness</summary>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Diligence:</b></p>
                <p>Diligence means being hardworking, dependable, and persistent—especially in our service to Jehovah. A diligent person gives their best and doesn’t give up easily. The Bible praises those who are “zealous,” “whole-souled,” and “not sluggish” in doing what is right.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The plans of the diligent surely lead to success.” (Proverbs 21:5)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah, and not for men.” (Colossians 3:23)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit. Slave for Jehovah.” (Romans 12:11)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Have Diligence:</b></p>
                <p>Diligence shows that we value Jehovah’s service and the responsibilities he gives us. It brings satisfaction, helps us grow spiritually, and keeps us ready for any test of faith. Jehovah blesses the efforts of those who keep working faithfully.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Become steadfast, immovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain.” (1 Corinthians 15:58)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The hand of the diligent will rule, but the lazy one will be put to forced labor.” (Proverbs 12:24)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out.” (Galatians 6:9)</p>
                <p><b>What the Bible Thinks About Laziness:</b></p>
                <p>Laziness is often connected with selfishness, lack of faith, and a poor spiritual outlook. The Bible warns that laziness leads to poverty, ruin, and spiritual sleep. A lazy person may avoid work, but in the end, it costs them more.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The lazy one says: ‘There is a lion outside! I will be killed in the public square!’” (Proverbs 22:13)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The desire of the lazy will kill him, for his hands refuse to work.” (Proverbs 21:25)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Go to the ant, you lazy one; observe its ways and become wise.” (Proverbs 6:6)</p>
                <p><b>Why We Should Not Have Laziness:</b></p>
                <p>Laziness can damage our relationship with Jehovah, prevent growth, and make us vulnerable to temptation. It reflects spiritual carelessness. Jehovah wants us to be alert, busy in his service, and productive in our daily life.</p>
                <p class="scripture">“How long will you lie there, you lazy one? When will you rise from your sleep?” (Proverbs 6:9)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“The one not working should not eat.” (2 Thessalonians 3:10)</p>
                <p class="scripture">“Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.” (1 Corinthians 16:13)</p>
