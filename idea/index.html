                <p><strong>I</strong>: You’re driving with a GPS, confident it’s leading you to your destination, but it takes you to a dead end. Many of us grow up with beliefs about God or life that feel right but don’t align with truth, like a misprogrammed GPS steering us off course.</p>
                <p><strong>D</strong>: How can we find the right path to God? “This means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3)</p>
                <p><strong>E</strong>: The Bible teaches that knowing Jehovah, the only true God, leads to everlasting life. Many beliefs, like the idea that all religions are equal, act like a faulty GPS, steering us away from truth. John 17:3 emphasizes the need for accurate knowledge about Jehovah and Jesus. The Bible, inspired by God, serves as a reliable guide (2 Timothy 3:16). By studying it, we can correct misconceptions and find the path to a relationship with Jehovah, who desires us to know Him. This first step invites you to question what you’ve been taught and seek God’s direction through His Word.</p>
                <p><strong>A</strong>: Reflect on a belief you’ve held about God. Does it match the Bible? Read John 17:3 and pray to Jehovah for guidance to find His truth.</p>

                <p><strong>I</strong>: A friend promises to help with a big project but doesn’t show up, making you question their care. Some view God as distant or harsh, wondering if He truly loves us.</p>
                <p><strong>D</strong>: How does Jehovah show His love? “Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love.” (Psalm 103:8)</p>
                <p><strong>E</strong>: Jehovah’s love is central to His personality. Psalm 103:8 describes Him as merciful and gracious, patiently offering love even when we err. He sent His Son, Jesus, to die for humanity, proving His deep care (John 3:16). Unlike human promises that fail, Jehovah’s love is loyal and unwavering. He listens to our prayers, provides guidance through the Bible, and promises a future free of pain (Revelation 21:4). This love invites us to draw close to Him, not out of fear, but with trust and affection, knowing He desires our happiness.</p>

                <p><strong>D</strong>: Does Jehovah notice individuals? “Are not five sparrows sold for two small coins? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.” (Luke 12:6, 7)</p>
                <p><strong>E</strong>: Jehovah’s love is personal. Luke 12:6, 7 shows He notices even small sparrows, and He knows every detail about you, even the number of your hairs. This care isn’t distant; Jehovah invites you to approach Him in prayer (Philippians 4:6). His love is shown in His desire for all to know Him and gain everlasting life. Unlike the world’s indifference, Jehovah values you as an individual, offering guidance and hope through His Word. This truth builds a foundation for a close, personal relationship with Him.</p>

                <p><strong>E</strong>: Jehovah’s love is reliable because He never lies or breaks His promises. Numbers 23:19 assures us that His words are trustworthy. He has fulfilled countless promises, like the birth of Jesus exactly as foretold (Isaiah 7:14). His love is shown in His plan to restore the earth to a paradise, where suffering will end (Psalm 37:29).

                <p><strong>E</strong>: Jehovah is not a distant God; He warmly invites us to know Him. James 4:8 promises that if we draw close to Him, He will respond. This invitation is shown through prayer, which He encourages us to offer anytime (1 Thessalonians 5:17). His Word, the Bible, reveals His thoughts and desires, allowing us to understand His loving personality. By studying Scripture and praying, we build a relationship with Jehovah, feeling His care and guidance. This open invitation shows His love, encouraging us to take the first step toward Him.</p>

                <p><strong>D</strong>: Why does Jehovah oppose sin? “You are too pure to look upon what is bad.” (Habakkuk 1:13)</p>
                <p><strong>E</strong>: Jehovah hates sin because it harms His creation, as Habakkuk 1:13 states. Sin, like rebellion against His standards, causes suffering and death (Romans 5:12).

                <p><strong>D</strong>: Why trust the Bible as God’s Word? “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight.” (2 Timothy 3:16)</p>
                <p><strong>E</strong>: The Bible claims to be inspired by Jehovah, and its internal harmony proves it. Written by about 40 men over 1,600 years, it remains consistent in its message of God’s purpose. Its candor, detailing the flaws of its writers, shows authenticity.

                <p><strong>E</strong>: The Bible’s advice is practical and timeless. Matthew 22:39 teaches love for others, fostering peace in relationships. Principles like honesty (Proverbs 12:19) and forgiveness (Ephesians 4:32) reduce conflict and stress. Unlike fleeting human advice, the Bible’s wisdom comes from Jehovah, who understands human needs.

                <p><strong>E</strong>: Jehovah’s ability to foretell the future sets the Bible apart. Isaiah 46:10 shows He declares events before they happen. For example, Daniel 2:28–45 predicted the rise and fall of world powers—Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome—centuries in advance. These fulfilled prophecies confirm the Bible’s divine origin.

                <p><strong>E</strong>: The Bible’s scientific accuracy strengthens its credibility. Job 36:27 describes the water cycle—evaporation and condensation—long before it was understood scientifically. Leviticus 13:4–5 outlines quarantine practices, predating germ theory by centuries. These examples show the Bible’s divine inspiration, as human writers lacked such knowledge.

                <p><strong>E</strong>: The Bible’s historical accuracy is well-documented. 2 Kings 17:24 mentions Assyrian resettlement, confirmed by archaeological finds like the Annals of Sargon II. The Bible’s details about kings, cities, and events, like the fall of Jericho (Joshua 6), align with archaeological evidence. Unlike myths, the Bible includes verifiable details, proving its reliability.

Its practical wisdom, like loving others (Matthew 7:12), brings peace. Its prophecies and accuracy prove its divine origin, while its promises, like eternal life (John 17:3), inspire hope.

                <p><strong>E</strong>: The Bible offers clear moral guidance, as Philippians 4:8 encourages us to focus on what is righteous. Its principles, like avoiding dishonesty (Proverbs 12:22) or sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18), protect us from harm and promote peace. Unlike shifting human standards, the Bible’s morals come from Jehovah’s perfect wisdom, ensuring they are timeless and beneficial. This moral clarity builds trust in the Bible as our guide.</p>

                <p><strong>D</strong>: Does the Bible provide comfort? “The God of all comfort... comforts us in all our trials.” (2 Corinthians 1:3, 4)</p>
                <p><strong>E</strong>: Jehovah is the “God of all comfort,” as 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4 states.

                <p><strong>E</strong>: The Bible explains that suffering stems from sin, inherited through Adam, as Romans 5:12 states. Satan’s rebellion also plays a role (1 John 5:19). Jehovah allows suffering temporarily to settle moral issues but promises to end it (Revelation 21:4).

                <p><strong>E</strong>: The Bible warns against following traditions that contradict God’s Word, as 1 Corinthians 4:6 advises.

                <p><strong>E</strong>: Many holidays, like Christmas or Halloween, have pagan roots, which 2 Corinthians 6:14 warns against mixing with true worship. The Bible condemns practices tied to false gods (Deuteronomy 12:30, 31). Jehovah desires worship free from pagan influences, based on truth (John 17:17).

                <p><strong>E</strong>: The cross has pagan origins, used in false worship long before Christianity. The Bible describes Jesus’ death on a stake (Acts 5:30, Greek: *xylon*). Using the cross in worship risks adopting pagan practices, which Jehovah rejects (Exodus 20:4, 5). True worship focuses on faith in Jesus’ sacrifice, not symbols.

                <p><strong>E</strong>: Jesus rejected titles that exalt individuals, as Matthew 23:8 teaches, emphasizing equality among Christians. Clergy titles, common in many religions, create divisions and mimic worldly hierarchies, which Jehovah disapproves (James 2:1–4). The Bible promotes humble service, not elevated status (1 Peter 5:3).

                <p><strong>E</strong>: Free will is a gift from Jehovah, but 1 Peter 2:16 teaches it should be used to serve Him, not to justify sin. Many religions misuse free will to ignore Bible standards, but Jehovah’s worship requires obedience to His laws (John 14:15). Using free will to follow Scripture shows love for Jehovah and trust in His guidance.</p>

Reincarnation, common in some religions, contradicts Jehovah’s plan for a resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:22). Trusting the Bible’s clear teaching shows our love for Jehovah’s truth and strengthens our faith in His Word.</p>
                <p><strong>A</strong>: Read Hebrews 9:27 and reject reincarnation. Pray for trust in Jehovah’s resurrection hope.</p>

                <p><strong>I</strong>: The idea of karma suggests actions return to you. Is this a Bible teaching?</p>
                <p><strong>D</strong>: Does the Bible teach karma? “Each one will receive his own reward according to his own work.” (1 Corinthians 3:8)</p>
                <p><strong>E</strong>: The Bible does not teach karma, which implies automatic cosmic justice. Instead, 1 Corinthians 3:8 shows Jehovah judges based on our actions, with mercy and justice (Romans 2:6). Unlike karma’s impersonal cycle, Jehovah’s judgment is personal, offering forgiveness (Psalm 86:5). Rejecting karma shows our trust in the Bible and love for Jehovah’s way.</p>
                <p><strong>A</strong>: Read 1 Corinthians 3:8 and reflect on Jehovah’s judgment. Pray for faith in His justice.</p>

                <p><strong>E</strong>: False religious teachings, like those promoting idols or pagan practices, lead us away from Jehovah, as 2 Corinthians 6:17 warns (Exodus 20:3–5). The Bible calls us to worship in truth, rejecting lies about God (John 4:23). By choosing Jehovah’s standards, we show love for Him and trust in His Word as the only true guide.</p>
                <p><strong>A</strong>: Read 2 Corinthians 6:17 and reject a false teaching. Pray for Jehovah’s help to stay true.</p>

It’s a step after learning Bible truth, showing our love for Jehovah (Matthew 28:19, 20). Baptism commits us to live by His standards, deepening our relationship with Him and trust in His Word.</p>

                <p><strong>E</strong>: Jehovah’s organization is His united group of worshippers, as 1 Corinthians 14:33 implies, working together to fulfill His purpose.

                <p><strong>E</strong>: The Bible describes a governing body in Acts 15:2, where apostles and elders made decisions for early Christians.

                <p><strong>E</strong>: Jehovah uses imperfect men to lead, as 2 Corinthians 4:7 shows, to highlight His power, not human ability. Leaders like Moses and Peter made mistakes but were guided by Jehovah (Numbers 20:12; Galatians 2:11). Today’s leaders follow the Bible, showing humility.
