                <h3>Does God Have a Name?</h3>
                <p>Many religions use titles like “Lord” or “God,” but the Bible reveals God’s personal name: Jehovah. This name appears over 7,000 times in Scripture, showing its importance (Exodus 3:15). In Isaiah 42:8, God declares, “I am Jehovah; that is my name.” The name Jehovah, meaning “He Causes to Become,” reflects His power to fulfill promises. The Dead Sea Scrolls confirm its use in ancient manuscripts, unlike vague deity concepts in Babylonian or Egyptian religions. Using Jehovah’s name fosters a personal relationship through prayer (Psalm 83:18), distinguishing true worship from human traditions and building trust in His Word.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why is using Jehovah’s name important for building a relationship with Him?</p>

                <h3>What Is Jehovah Like?</h3>
                <p>Jehovah is a loving, approachable God, not a distant deity. The Bible says, “God is love” (1 John 4:8), with qualities of justice, wisdom, and mercy (Psalm 89:14). He provides creation’s beauty (Psalm 19:1) and sent Jesus to die for us (John 3:16). Unlike vengeful gods in Greek mythology, Jehovah is patient, desiring all to know Him (2 Peter 3:9). Secular records, like Babylonian chronicles, align with fulfilled prophecies (Isaiah 13:19), proving His reliability. Knowing Jehovah’s character builds trust in His guidance over human philosophies.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> How does Jehovah’s love motivate you to learn more about Him?</p>

                <h3>Why Trust the Bible?</h3>
                <p>The Bible is God’s inspired Word, reliable for guidance. It says, “All Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16). Archaeological finds, like the Tel Dan Stele mentioning King David, confirm its accuracy. Scientifically, it notes the earth hangs on nothing (Job 26:7), predating modern discoveries. Over 1,000 prophecies, like Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), were fulfilled precisely, unlike vague Nostradamus predictions. The Bible’s consistency across centuries contrasts with shifting human ideas, building trust in Jehovah’s Word.</p>

                <h3>How Can We Talk to Jehovah?</h3>
                <p>Prayer is a personal way to approach Jehovah. The Bible says, “The eyes of Jehovah are on the righteous” (1 Peter 3:12). Jesus taught us to use Jehovah’s name in prayer (Matthew 6:9), unlike ritualistic chants in Hinduism. Daniel’s answered prayers (Daniel 9:19) and historical records of faithful Jews show Jehovah listens. Prayer fosters trust by allowing us to express gratitude and seek guidance (Philippians 4:6), distinguishing true worship from formal religious rites and deepening our relationship with Jehovah.</p>

                <h3>Who Is Jesus Christ?</h3>
                <p>Jesus is Jehovah’s Son, sent to save us. He said, “I am the way and the truth” (John 14:6). As God’s first creation (Colossians 1:15), Jesus is subordinate to Jehovah (1 Corinthians 11:3), unlike trinitarian doctrines. His life, verified by historian Josephus, fulfilled prophecies (Isaiah 7:14). Jesus’ sacrifice (John 15:13) reflects Jehovah’s love. Trusting Jesus’ role as mediator (1 Timothy 2:5) strengthens faith in Jehovah’s plan, rejecting false teachings and guiding us to true worship.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> How does Jesus’ example help you trust Jehovah’s purpose?</p>

                <h3>Why Study the Bible?</h3>
                <p>Studying the Bible draws us closer to Jehovah. It says, “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you” (James 4:8). The Bible reveals His will, like paradise earth (Psalm 37:29). Archaeological finds, like the Cyrus Cylinder (Ezra 1:1–3), confirm its history. Unlike Confucian texts lacking prophecy, the Bible’s principles (Colossians 3:9, 10) guide reliably. Regular study builds trust in Jehovah’s Word, equipping us for wise decisions and faith.</p>

                <h3>How Do Prophecies Prove the Bible’s Truth?</h3>
                <p>Bible prophecies prove Jehovah’s reliability. Isaiah 46:10 says, “I have told you the future from the beginning.” Daniel’s prophecy (Daniel 2:36–45) predicted empires—Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome—confirmed by historical records like Herodotus. Over 300 prophecies about Jesus (Isaiah 53:5) were fulfilled, unlike vague Mayan predictions. This precision shows divine inspiration, encouraging trust in Jehovah’s Word over human philosophies and preparing us to reject false teachings.</p>

                <h3>Is the Bible Scientifically Accurate?</h3>
                <p>The Bible aligns with science, proving its inspiration. It describes the earth as a sphere (Isaiah 40:22) and suspended in space (Job 26:7), facts unknown in ancient times. Unlike Egyptian myths of a flat earth, the Bible’s hygiene laws (Leviticus 11:28) show wisdom. Its creation account (Genesis 1:1) matches scientific evidence of a beginning. This accuracy builds trust in Jehovah as Creator, guiding us to rely on His Word over secular theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> How does the Bible’s scientific accuracy affect your view of it?</p>

                <h3>Why Is the Bible Historically Reliable?</h3>
                <p>The Bible’s history is trustworthy. It says, “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). The Moabite Stone confirms events like 2 Kings 3, and Roman historian Tacitus mentions Jesus. Unlike mythical epics like the Iliad, the Bible names real places and people, corroborated by archaeology. Its preservation across centuries shows divine care. Trusting its history strengthens our confidence in Jehovah’s Word as a reliable guide for life and worship.</p>

                <h3>What Are Jehovah’s Promises?</h3>
                <p>Jehovah’s promises give hope. Joshua 23:14 says, “Not one of all the good promises Jehovah made has failed.” He promises paradise (Psalm 37:11), eternal life (John 17:3), and guidance (Isaiah 30:21). Historical fulfillments, like Israel’s return from Babylon (Jeremiah 29:10), confirmed by the Cyrus Cylinder, prove His reliability. Unlike human promises, Jehovah’s are certain (Titus 1:2), encouraging trust in His Word and motivating obedience to draw closer to Him.</p>

                <h3>How Does Faith Build Trust?</h3>
                <p>Faith is essential to trust Jehovah. Hebrews 11:6 says, “Without faith it is impossible to please God.” Abraham’s trust (Genesis 15:6) and Noah’s obedience (Hebrews 11:7) show faith brings blessings. Unlike blind belief in Buddhism, Biblical faith is evidence-based (Romans 1:20). Historical examples, like Daniel’s deliverance (Daniel 6:23), prove Jehovah’s support. Building faith through study strengthens our trust in Jehovah, preparing us for true worship.</p>

                <h3>Why Obey Jehovah?</h3>
                <p>Obedience shows love and trust in Jehovah. The Bible says, “This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments” (1 John 5:3). His laws, like avoiding dishonesty (Proverbs 12:22), bring happiness, unlike restrictive religious rules. David’s obedience (1 Samuel 15:22) led to blessings, as seen in historical records. Obeying Jehovah contrasts with worldly rebellion, building a relationship with Him and preparing us to reject false teachings.</p>

                <h3>How Does Jehovah Forgive?</h3>
                <p>Jehovah’s forgiveness reflects His mercy. The Bible says, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us” (1 John 1:9). Jesus’ sacrifice enables forgiveness (Ephesians 1:7). Unlike judgmental religions, Jehovah forgave David (Psalm 51:1–2), as historical accounts confirm (2 Samuel 12:13). Trusting His forgiveness encourages repentance, drawing us closer to Jehovah and building confidence in His loving standards over human traditions.</p>

                <h3>Why Be Grateful to Jehovah?</h3>
                <p>Gratitude deepens trust in Jehovah. The Bible says, “In everything give thanks” (1 Thessalonians 5:18). He provides life, creation, and guidance (Psalm 136:1). Unlike ritual-based religions, Jehovah values heartfelt gratitude, as seen in the Israelites’ songs (Exodus 15:1). Historical records of their deliverance confirm His care. Expressing gratitude strengthens faith, helping us trust Jehovah’s promises and reject empty traditions for a closer relationship with Him.</p>

                <h3>How Does Love Show Trust?</h3>
                <p>Loving others reflects trust in Jehovah. Jesus said, “Love one another; just as I have loved you” (John 13:34). His sacrifice (John 15:13) and early Christians’ sharing (Acts 4:32) show love’s power, unlike selfish philosophies. Historical records of Christian unity contrast with divided religions. By loving others, we trust Jehovah’s standards (1 Corinthians 13:4–7), building a relationship with Him and preparing to reject false teachings.</p>

                <h3>Why Endure Trials?</h3>
                <p>Enduring trials builds trust in Jehovah. Romans 5:3 says, “Tribulation produces endurance.” Job’s perseverance (James 5:11) and Daniel’s deliverance (Daniel 6:23) show Jehovah’s support (Psalm 55:22). Unlike religions offering quick fixes, the Bible teaches trials strengthen faith. Historical accounts of faithful Jews enduring exile confirm this. Enduring with prayer and study trusts Jehovah’s promises, preparing us for true worship free from worldly distractions.</p>

                <p>Humility shows trust in Jehovah’s guidance. James 4:10 says, “Humble yourselves in the sight of Jehovah.” Jesus’ humility (Philippians 2:8) contrasts with proud religious leaders. Moses’ humility (Numbers 12:3) brought blessings, as historical records show. Unlike worldly pride, humility aligns us with Jehovah’s will (Micah 6:8), building faith and preparing us to reject false teachings for true worship.</p>

                <h3>Why Avoid Temptation?</h3>
                <p>Avoiding temptation shows trust in Jehovah. The Bible says, “God will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear” (1 Corinthians 10:13). Jesus resisted Satan (Matthew 4:10), and Joseph fled immorality (Genesis 39:9), as historical accounts confirm. Unlike religions excusing sin, Jehovah’s standards protect us (1 Thessalonians 4:3). Trusting His guidance helps us make wise choices, strengthening faith and preparing for true worship.</p>

                <p>Jehovah’s hope gives purpose. The Bible says, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29). Unlike vague afterlife beliefs, Jehovah promises a paradise earth (Revelation 21:4). Historical prophecies, like Israel’s restoration (Ezekiel 36:24), show reliability. Trusting this hope focuses us on Jehovah’s will, encouraging study and obedience to prepare for true worship and reject false teachings.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> How does Jehovah’s hope for a paradise earth motivate you?</p>

                <h3>How Can We Worship Jehovah?</h3>
                <p>Worshipping Jehovah builds trust. The Bible says, “Those worshipping him must worship with spirit and truth” (John 4:24). Unlike ritualistic religions, true worship involves heartfelt prayer, study, and obedience (Matthew 15:8, 9). Early Christians’ simple worship (Acts 2:42) contrasts with pagan ceremonies. Historical records confirm their devotion. Worshipping in truth trusts Jehovah’s standards, preparing us to reject false teachings and embrace pure worship.</p>

                <h3>Why Examine Ourselves?</h3>
                <p>Examining ourselves ensures we follow Jehovah’s truth. The Bible says, “Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith” (2 Corinthians 13:5). Unlike blind tradition-followers, we must test our beliefs (1 Thessalonians 5:21). Jesus’ humility (Philippians 2:5–8) sets a standard. Historical Christians, like the Bereans (Acts 17:11), verified teachings. Self-examination builds trust in Jehovah’s Word, aligning our lives with His standards and preparing us for pure worship.</p>

                <p>Testing beliefs keeps worship pure. The Bible says, “Test all things; hold fast to what is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:21). Early Christians, like the Bereans (Acts 17:11), checked Paul’s teachings against Scripture, unlike tradition-bound Pharisees. Historical records confirm their diligence. Testing beliefs ensures we follow Jehovah’s Word, not human ideas, building trust and preparing us to reject false teachings for true worship.</p>

Unlike pagan rituals, true worship involves heartfelt prayer, study, and obedience (Matthew 15:8, 9). Early Christians focused on Scripture (Acts 2:42), as historical records show.

Unlike ritualistic services, Jehovah’s meetings focus on Bible instruction (Acts 2:42). Early Christians met regularly (1 Corinthians 14:26), as historical accounts confirm. Attending shows trust in Jehovah’s organization, preparing us to reject divided religions and align with His truth for pure worship.</p>

                <h3>Why Get Baptized?</h3>
                <p>Baptism is a vital step in trusting Jehovah. Acts 2:38 says, “Repent, and let each one of you be baptized.” It symbolizes dedication to Jehovah and acceptance of Jesus’ sacrifice (1 Peter 3:21). Unlike infant baptism, a human tradition, true baptism follows learning God’s truth (Matthew 28:19, 20). Early Christians, like those in Philippi (Acts 16:33), were baptized as adults. Baptism shows trust in Jehovah’s standards, preparing us for pure worship.</p>

                <h3>What Is Jehovah’s Organization?</h3>
                <p>Jehovah’s organization is His united worshippers. The Bible says, “God is a God not of disorder but of peace” (1 Corinthians 14:33). Unlike fragmented religions, Jehovah’s Witnesses follow Bible-based guidance (Acts 15:28, 29). Early Christians showed unity (Acts 2:46), as historical records confirm. Trusting Jehovah’s organization rejects human traditions, aligning us with His structure for true worship.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why is supporting Jehovah’s organization important for true worship?</p>

                <h3>Who Leads Jehovah’s People?</h3>
                <p>Jehovah’s people are led by a governing body, guided by His spirit (Acts 15:28). The Bible shows apostles and elders making decisions (Acts 15:2). Unlike clergy hierarchies, today’s leaders follow Scripture, as seen in Paul’s example (Acts 20:28). Historical records confirm early Christian unity. Trusting these leaders rejects human traditions, ensuring our worship aligns with Jehovah’s truth.</p>

                <h3>Why Use Imperfect Leaders?</h3>
                <p>Jehovah uses imperfect men to lead. The Bible says, “We have this treasure in earthen vessels” (2 Corinthians 4:7). Moses made mistakes but was guided by Jehovah (Numbers 20:12). Unlike proud clergy, Jehovah’s leaders follow Scripture humbly (1 Peter 5:3). Historical examples, like Peter’s humility (Galatians 2:11–14), show Jehovah’s power. Trusting imperfect leaders prepares us for true worship, rejecting worldly hierarchies.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why does Jehovah’s use of imperfect leaders strengthen your faith?</p>

                <h3>Why Share Bible Truth?</h3>
                <p>Sharing Bible truth builds trust in Jehovah. Matthew 24:14 says, “This good news of the Kingdom will be preached.” Jesus (Luke 4:43) and early Christians (Acts 8:4) shared boldly, as historical records confirm. Unlike passive religions, Jehovah’s people teach actively, rejecting false beliefs. Preaching strengthens our faith and shows love, preparing us for pure worship aligned with Jehovah’s purpose, not traditions.</p>

                <h3>Why Reflect on Our Spiritual Progress?</h3>
                <p>Reflecting on our spiritual progress strengthens trust in Jehovah. The Bible says, “Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith” (2 Corinthians 13:5). David prayed, “Examine me, O Jehovah” (Psalm 26:2), and Galatians 6:4 urges self-assessment. Unlike ritualistic religions, Jehovah values personal growth, as seen in Paul’s reflection (Philippians 3:13, 14). Historical Christians, like the Bereans (Acts 17:11), evaluated their faith. Reflection ensures our trust aligns with Jehovah’s standards, preparing us for pure worship.</p>

                <h3>Does Free Will Mean No Rules?</h3>
                <p>Free will is a gift, but not without boundaries. The Bible says, “Be as free people, and yet holding your freedom… as slaves of God” (1 Peter 2:16). Many religions misuse free will to ignore God’s laws, but Jehovah requires obedience (John 14:15). Adam’s misuse of free will (Genesis 3:6) brought consequences, as historical records of early humanity suggest. Using free will to follow Scripture rejects worldly traditions, ensuring true worship aligned with Jehovah’s standards.</p>

                <h3>Why Avoid Idolatry?</h3>
                <p>Idolatry opposes Jehovah’s truth. Exodus 20:4 says, “You must not make for yourself a carved image.” Many religions use statues, but Jehovah demands exclusive devotion (Deuteronomy 6:14). Israel’s rejection of idols (Judges 10:16), confirmed by archaeology, shows the need for pure worship. Unlike Hindu idol worship, Jehovah’s standards focus on spiritual devotion. Avoiding idolatry ensures we honor Jehovah alone, rejecting false practices for true worship.</p>

                <h3>Is the Cross a Christian Symbol?</h3>
                <p>The cross is not a Biblical symbol. Acts 5:30 says Jesus died on a stake (Greek: *xylon*), not a cross. Historical evidence, like pagan crosses in Babylonian worship, shows its non-Christian origin, which Jehovah condemns (Exodus 20:4, 5). Unlike religions using symbols, the Bible urges faith without icons (2 Corinthians 5:7). Rejecting the cross ensures true worship, aligning with Jehovah’s truth and avoiding traditions that dishonor Him.</p>

                <h3>Why Avoid Pagan Holidays?</h3>
                <p>Holidays like Christmas and Halloween have pagan roots. 2 Corinthians 6:14 warns, “What fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have?” Christmas ties to Roman Saturnalia, and Halloween to Celtic spiritism, as historical records show, which Jehovah rejects (Deuteronomy 12:30, 31). Unlike these, true worship honors Jesus’ memorial (Luke 22:19). Avoiding pagan holidays ensures pure worship, aligning with Jehovah’s truth over traditions.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> How can avoiding pagan holidays help you worship Jehovah purely?</p>

                <h3>Is Easter a Christian Holiday?</h3>
                <p>Easter has pagan origins, not Biblical ones. The Bible commands commemorating Jesus’ death (Luke 22:19), not his resurrection with traditions like eggs and rabbits, tied to Babylonian fertility rites (Deuteronomy 12:30, 31). Historical records confirm these pagan roots. True worship focuses on Jesus’ sacrifice (1 Corinthians 5:7). Rejecting Easter ensures we honor Jehovah’s truth, avoiding traditions that compromise pure worship.</p>

                <h3>Is the Immortal Soul Biblical?</h3>
                <p>The immortal soul is not Biblical. Ezekiel 18:4 says, “The soul that sins—it itself will die.” The dead are unconscious (Ecclesiastes 9:5), awaiting resurrection (John 5:28, 29). Unlike Egyptian afterlife myths, the Bible teaches mortality, as seen in Lazarus’ resurrection (John 11:43, 44). Historical Christian teachings reject immortality doctrines. Embracing this truth ensures pure worship, aligning with Jehovah’s promise of resurrection, not pagan beliefs.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why does rejecting the immortal soul doctrine align with Jehovah’s truth?</p>

                <h3>Is Hellfire a Bible Teaching?</h3>
                <p>Hellfire is not Biblical. Romans 6:23 says, “The wages sin pays is death,” not torment. Jehovah, a God of love (1 John 4:8), does not burn people, as Ecclesiastes 9:5 confirms unconsciousness in death. Hellfire stems from Babylonian myths, unlike the Bible’s resurrection hope (John 5:28, 29). Historical Christian martyrs rejected such fears. Rejecting hellfire ensures true worship, trusting Jehovah’s justice over pagan traditions.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why does rejecting hellfire strengthen your faith in Jehovah’s justice?</p>

                <h3>Is the Trinity Biblical?</h3>
                <p>The Trinity is not Biblical. John 14:28 says, “The Father is greater than I am,” showing Jesus’ subordination (1 Corinthians 11:3). The term “Trinity” is absent from Scripture, rooted in Babylonian and Egyptian triads, as historical records show. Early Christians worshipped one God, Jehovah (Deuteronomy 6:4). Rejecting the Trinity ensures true worship, aligning with Jehovah’s clear truth and avoiding confusing pagan doctrines.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why does rejecting the Trinity align your worship with Jehovah’s truth?</p>

                <p>Karma is not Biblical. The Bible says, “Each one will receive his own reward according to his own work” (1 Corinthians 3:8), under Jehovah’s judgment (Romans 2:6). Unlike karma’s impersonal cycle, Jehovah offers mercy (Psalm 86:5). Historical examples, like David’s forgiveness (2 Samuel 12:13), show personal justice. Rejecting karma ensures true worship, aligning with Jehovah’s truth, not Eastern traditions.</p>

                <p>Reincarnation contradicts the Bible. Hebrews 9:27 says, “It is reserved for men to die once for all time,” awaiting resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:22). Unlike Hindu beliefs, the Bible’s hope is clear, as seen in Jesus’ resurrection (Luke 24:46). Historical Christian teachings, like those of the apostles (Acts 17:31), reject rebirth. Rejecting reincarnation ensures true worship, aligning with Jehovah’s resurrection promise.</p>

                <p>The Bible teaches death is unconsciousness, like sleep. Ecclesiastes 9:5 says, “The dead know nothing at all.” Unlike Egyptian afterlife myths, the Bible promises resurrection (John 5:28, 29). Lazarus’ resurrection (John 11:43, 44) confirms this hope, as historical Christian teachings show. Rejecting false afterlife beliefs ensures true worship, aligning with Jehovah’s comforting truth and preparing us for His promises.</p>

                <h3>What Is the Resurrection?</h3>
                <p>The resurrection is Jehovah’s promise to restore life. John 5:28, 29 says, “All those in the memorial tombs will… come out.” Most will live on a paradise earth (Psalm 37:29), while 144,000 rule in heaven (Revelation 7:4). Unlike reincarnation, the Bible’s hope is clear, as seen in Jesus’ resurrection (Luke 24:46). Historical Christian belief confirms this. Embracing resurrection ensures true worship, rejecting false traditions.</p>

                <p>Many believe heaven is the reward, but the Bible says, “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29). Most will live in paradise, while 144,000 rule in heaven (Revelation 14:1–3). Unlike universal heaven teachings, God’s promise to Abraham (Genesis 12:7) points to earth, as historical records suggest. Rejecting false hopes ensures true worship, aligning with Jehovah’s purpose.</p>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Why is the Bible’s earthly hope important for true worship?</p>

                <p>Clergy titles, like “Reverend,” create divisions. Matthew 23:8 says, “Do not be called ‘Rabbi,’ for… all of you are brothers.” Jesus rejected titles (1 Peter 5:3), unlike religious hierarchies. Early Christians avoided titles (Acts 20:28), as historical records show. Avoiding titles ensures true worship, rejecting prideful traditions and aligning with Jehovah’s emphasis on equality and humility.</p>

                <p>False prophets lead away from Jehovah’s truth. Matthew 7:15 warns, “Be on the watch for the false prophets.” Their predictions fail (Deuteronomy 18:22), unlike Jehovah’s fulfilled prophecies. Hananiah’s false prophecy (Jeremiah 28:15–17) shows the danger, as historical records confirm. Rejecting false prophets ensures true worship, aligning with Jehovah’s Word (2 Timothy 3:16) over misleading traditions.</p>

                <p>The Bible’s “spirit” (Hebrew: *ruach*, Greek: *pneuma*) means breath of life (Genesis 2:7) or invisible forces like angels (Hebrews 1:14), not an immortal soul. Unlike Greek philosophy’s eternal spirit, the Bible shows spirit as God’s active force (Acts 1:8). Early Christians rejected pagan spiritism (1 Corinthians 10:20), as historical records confirm. Understanding spirit ensures true worship, rejecting false doctrines and aligning with Jehovah’s truth.</p>

                <p>Blood is sacred, representing life. Genesis 9:4 and Leviticus 17:11 forbid its misuse, and Acts 15:29 commands abstaining from blood, including transfusions. Early Christians refused pagan blood rituals, as historical records show, choosing martyrdom. Unlike secular views prioritizing survival, Jehovah’s Witnesses trust Jehovah’s wisdom (John 17:3). Respecting blood’s sanctity ensures true worship, rejecting human traditions for Jehovah’s standards.</p>

                <p>Satan, “the god of this system” (2 Corinthians 4:4), promotes false worship through deception (Revelation 12:9). Babylonian mysticism influenced modern traditions, as historical records show. The Bible urges resisting Satan (James 4:7). Early Christians avoided his traps (1 Peter 5:8), unlike pagan religions. Recognizing Satan’s role ensures true worship, rejecting false teachings and aligning with Jehovah’s truth for pure devotion.</p>

                <p>Jehovah’s people remain neutral, separate from worldly conflicts (John 17:16). Jesus refused political involvement (John 6:15), and early Christians avoided Roman politics, as historical records confirm. Unlike religions supporting wars, neutrality shows loyalty to Jehovah’s Kingdom (Daniel 2:44). Staying neutral ensures true worship, rejecting human agendas and aligning with Jehovah’s purpose for peace and unity.</p>

Unlike apocalyptic myths, the Bible’s signs (Matthew 24:7) are clear, as historical global unrest shows. Preparing through obedience ensures survival into paradise (Zephaniah 2:3). Rejecting false end-time views aligns worship with Jehovah’s truth, strengthening faith in His promises.</p>

                <p>The year 1914 marks the start of Jesus’ heavenly rule, as Daniel 4’s “seven times” prophecy (2,520 years from Jerusalem’s fall in 607 BCE) indicates. Revelation 12:7–12 describes Satan’s expulsion, intensifying woes. Historical events—World War I’s outbreak, global pandemics, and unrest (Matthew 24:7)—confirm the “last days” (2 Timothy 3:1–5). Unlike vague eschatology, this prophecy aligns with history, ensuring true worship by trusting Jehovah’s timeline.</p>

                <h3>Why Did Christianity Compromise with Paganism?</h3>
                <p>Christianity compromised with paganism to gain acceptance. After Jesus’ death, apostasy grew (2 Thessalonians 2:3). Constantine’s 4th-century adoption of pagan symbols, like the cross, and the Council of Nicaea’s Trinity doctrine (325 CE) blended Babylonian and Egyptian beliefs, as historical records confirm. The Bible warns against mixing worship (2 Corinthians 6:14–17). Unlike compromised religions, true worship rejects pagan traditions, aligning with Jehovah’s standards for purity.</p>

                <h3>What Does Cleansing the Temple Teach Us?</h3>
                <p>Cleansing the temple shows zeal for pure worship. Hezekiah purified the temple (2 Chronicles 29:15–19), and Josiah removed idols (2 Kings 23:4–7), as archaeological finds confirm. Jesus cleansed the temple twice (John 2:15; Matthew 21:12), rejecting corruption. These examples teach us to remove false teachings, like pagan holidays, from worship. Cleansing our worship ensures we honor Jehovah purely, free from traditions.</p>

                <h3>Why Avoid Worldly Entertainment?</h3>
                <p>Worldly entertainment often promotes values against Jehovah’s standards. Psalm 101:3 says, “I will not set anything worthless before my eyes.” Many movies and music glorify violence or immorality, unlike the Bible’s call for pure thoughts (Philippians 4:8).

Unlike compromising religions, preparing through prayer and study (1 Peter 4:7) strengthens us to reject false teachings.

Revelation 21:4 promises, “Death will be no more.” Unlike vague religious hopes, Jehovah’s reward is clear (Psalm 37:29), as fulfilled prophecies like Israel’s restoration (Ezekiel 36:24) confirm. Early Christians endured for this hope (Hebrews 10:36), as historical records show. True worship, free from tradition, aligns us with Jehovah’s purpose, ensuring His promised blessings.</p>
