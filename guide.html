            { 
                title: "1. Why Study the Bible?", 
                instruction: "The Bible stands as Jehovah’s inspired Word, a divine gift distinct from human philosophies or religious texts rooted in false worship, such as pagan myths or materialistic ideologies. It reveals God’s will and purpose for humanity, offering guidance for life’s challenges, as affirmed by 2 Timothy 3:16: 'All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.' Historically, its preservation through centuries—despite attempts to suppress it—demonstrates divine protection. Scientifically, its references, like the earth’s suspension (Job 26:7), align with later discoveries, proving its reliability. Studying it equips us to reject false teachings, like idol worship or soul immortality, and fosters a relationship with Jehovah based on truth.", 
                description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Wisdom and protection from false teachings.", 
                example: "<b>2 Timothy 3:16</b> - All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.\n<b>Joshua 1:8</b> - This book of the Law should not depart from your mouth, and you must read it in an undertone day and night.\n<b>Psalm 119:105</b> - Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light for my path." 
            },
            { 
                title: "2. Who Wrote the Bible?", 
                instruction: "The Bible was penned by over 40 human writers—kings, prophets, fishermen—spanning 1,600 years, yet its unity stems from Jehovah’s holy spirit, as 2 Peter 1:21 states: 'Men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.' Unlike pagan texts filled with contradictory myths, its consistent message across centuries proves divine authorship. Historically, its composition began with Moses around 1513 B.C.E. and concluded with John’s writings around 98 C.E., surviving persecution and translation into thousands of languages. Science supports its accuracy, such as the hydrologic cycle in Job 36:27-28, predating modern understanding. This refutes false worship’s claim of human origin, affirming Jehovah as its true Author.", 
                description: "<b>History:</b> Unified over 1,600 years.", 
                example: "<b>2 Peter 1:21</b> - Men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.\n<b>2 Timothy 3:16</b> - All Scripture is inspired of God.\n<b>Isaiah 40:8</b> - The word of our God endures forever." 
            },
            { 
                title: "3. Is the Bible Scientifically Accurate?", 
                instruction: "The Bible’s scientific accuracy shines through statements made long before human discovery, such as Job 26:7: 'He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.' This aligns with the earth’s suspension in space, a fact unknown in ancient times. Unlike false worship’s flat-earth myths or Babylonian cosmologies, Isaiah 40:22 describes Jehovah as 'the One who dwells above the circle of the earth,' hinting at its spherical shape. Historically, its sanitation laws (Leviticus 11-15) predate germ theory, saving lives. These facts dismantle claims of inaccuracy, proving the Bible’s divine origin and its superiority over pagan falsehoods.", 
                description: "<b>Science:</b> Earth’s shape and suspension.", 
                example: "<b>Job 26:7</b> - He suspends the earth upon nothing.\n<b>Isaiah 40:22</b> - He dwells above the circle of the earth.\n<b>Job 36:27-28</b> - He draws up the drops of water; they filter as rain." 
            },
            { 
                title: "4. What Is God’s Name?", 
                instruction: "Jehovah, God’s personal name, appears over 7,000 times in the original texts, as Psalm 83:18 declares: 'You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.' False worship obscures this name with titles like 'Lord,' a practice rooted in superstition and tradition, not Scripture. Historically, the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) was revered by Israel, yet removed by later scribes influenced by pagan customs. Science offers no contradiction, but the Bible’s consistent use across millennia confirms its authenticity. Knowing Jehovah’s name sets true worship apart from the nameless deities of false religion.", 
                description: "<b>Origin:</b> YHWH, often removed.", 
                example: "<b>Psalm 83:18</b> - You, whose name is Jehovah, are the Most High.\n<b>Exodus 3:15</b> - Jehovah... this is my name forever.\n<b>Isaiah 42:8</b> - I am Jehovah. That is my name." 
            },
            { 
                title: "5. Who Is Jesus Christ?", 
                instruction: "Jesus Christ is Jehovah’s firstborn Son, not God Almighty, as Colossians 1:15 states: 'He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.' False worship, like the Trinity doctrine from pagan triads, equates him with Jehovah, but Scripture distinguishes them. Historically, Jesus’ role as Messiah was foretold (Isaiah 9:6) and fulfilled in 29 C.E., initiating Christianity. Science aligns with his miracles, like healing, as acts of divine power, not myth. He’s the ransom and future King, refuting false claims of co-equality and affirming Jehovah’s supremacy in true worship.", 
                description: "<b>Role:</b> Son and Savior.", 
                example: "<b>Colossians 1:15</b> - The firstborn of all creation.\n<b>John 3:16</b> - God gave his only-begotten Son.\n<b>1 Timothy 2:5</b> - One God, and one mediator, Christ Jesus." 
            },
            { 
                title: "6. What Is the Holy Spirit?", 
                instruction: "The holy spirit is Jehovah’s active force, not a person, as Genesis 1:2 reveals: 'God’s active force was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.' False worship’s Trinity portrays it as a deity, borrowing from pagan trios like Egypt’s Osiris-Isis-Horus, but the Bible shows it as God’s power at work. Historically, it inspired prophets and empowered Jesus’ miracles (Luke 4:1). Scientifically, its effects—like creation’s order—suggest a purposeful force, not a random entity. Understanding this counters false teachings and honors Jehovah’s true nature.", 
                description: "<b>Use:</b> God’s power.", 
                example: "<b>Genesis 1:2</b> - God’s active force was moving.\n<b>Job 26:13</b> - By his spirit the heavens were made.\n<b>Luke 4:1</b> - Jesus, full of holy spirit." 
            },
            { 
                title: "7. Why Did God Create the Earth?", 
                instruction: "Jehovah created the earth as a permanent home for humanity, as Isaiah 45:18 affirms: 'He is the One who formed the earth... who firmly established it, who did not create it simply for nothing, but formed it to be inhabited.' False worship teaches a temporary earth or soul ascension, echoing pagan afterlife myths, but the Bible promises an eternal paradise. Historically, Genesis records this purpose from creation’s start. Science supports an earth designed for life—its water, air, and ecosystems—refuting chance. This truth inspires hope in Jehovah’s original plan.", 
                description: "<b>Purpose:</b> A lasting home.", 
                example: "<b>Psalm 104:5</b> - The earth will not be moved forever.\n<b>Isaiah 45:18</b> - He formed it to be inhabited.\n<b>Genesis 1:28</b> - Fill the earth and subdue it." 
            },
            { 
                title: "8. What Is Sin?", 
                instruction: "Sin is any act or thought that misses Jehovah’s perfect standards, inherited from Adam, as Romans 3:23 states: 'All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.' False worship minimizes sin with rituals or excuses, like pagan sacrifices to appease gods, but the Bible calls it rebellion against Jehovah. Historically, sin entered through Adam’s disobedience in Eden (Genesis 3). Science shows human imperfection—disease and death—as sin’s effects, not evolution’s design. Recognizing sin’s gravity drives us to seek Jehovah’s forgiveness, not human solutions.", 
                description: "<b>Origin:</b> Rebellion against God.", 
                example: "<b>Romans 3:23</b> - All have sinned.\n<b>Genesis 3:6</b> - She took some of its fruit and ate.\n<b>1 John 3:4</b> - Sin is lawlessness." 
            },
            { 
                title: "9. Why Do We Die?", 
                instruction: "Death results from sin, not Jehovah’s original intent, as Romans 5:12 explains: 'Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin.' False worship’s soul immortality, rooted in Babylonian and Greek myths, contradicts this, but the Bible promises death’s end (1 Corinthians 15:26). Historically, Adam’s sin in 4026 B.C.E. (per Bible chronology) introduced mortality. Science confirms death as universal, unlike false claims of eternal consciousness. Jehovah’s purpose to eliminate death offers hope beyond pagan lies.", 
                description: "<b>History:</b> From Adam’s sin.", 
                example: "<b>Romans 5:12</b> - Death spread to all men.\n<b>Romans 6:23</b> - The wages sin pays is death.\n<b>1 Corinthians 15:26</b> - Death is to be brought to nothing." 
            },
            { 
                title: "10. What Is the Soul?", 
                instruction: "The soul is the living person—body and breath—not an immortal entity, as Genesis 2:7 states: 'Jehovah God went on to form the man... and the man became a living soul.' False worship’s spirit survival, from Egyptian and Hindu beliefs, clashes with Ezekiel 18:4: 'The soul who sins is the one who will die.' Historically, this truth shaped Israel’s rejection of afterlife myths. Science shows life ceases without breath or blood, aligning with Scripture, not paganism. This clarifies Jehovah’s resurrection hope over false immortality.", 
                description: "<b>Science:</b> Life ends without breath.", 
                example: "<b>Genesis 2:7</b> - The man became a living soul.\n<b>Ezekiel 18:4</b> - The soul who sins will die.\n<b>Ecclesiastes 9:10</b> - No work in the Grave." 
            },
            { 
                title: "11. What Is False Worship?", 
                instruction: "False worship defies Jehovah’s standards through idolatry and human traditions, as 1 John 5:21 warns: 'Guard yourselves from idols.' Unlike true worship, it includes pagan practices like statue veneration or polytheism, condemned in Exodus 20:4-5. Historically, Israel battled Canaanite idol worship, a struggle echoed today in religious syncretism. Science exposes idols as powerless—mere stone or wood—while the Bible’s God creates and sustains life. Rejecting false worship aligns us with Jehovah’s exclusive glory.", 
                description: "<b>Fact:</b> Defies God’s exclusivity.", 
                example: "<b>1 John 5:21</b> - Guard yourselves from idols.\n<b>Exodus 20:4-5</b> - You must not bow down to them.\n<b>Deuteronomy 4:39</b> - Jehovah is the true God." 
            },
            { 
                title: "12. What Is Prayer?", 
                instruction: "Prayer is personal communication with Jehovah, not rote chants or idol pleas, as Philippians 4:6 instructs: 'In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.' False worship uses repetitive formulas or intermediaries, like pagan priests, but Jesus taught direct access (John 16:23). Historically, faithful ones like Daniel prayed sincerely, not ritually. Science shows prayer’s calming effect, supporting its purpose in building faith. True prayer strengthens our bond with Jehovah, free of false traditions.", 
                description: "<b>Purpose:</b> Connection with Jehovah.", 
                example: "<b>Philippians 4:6</b> - Let your petitions be made known.\n<b>Matthew 6:7</b> - Do not say the same things over.\n<b>John 16:23</b> - Ask the Father in my name." 
            },
            { 
                title: "13. Why Have Faith?", 
                instruction: "Faith is confident trust in Jehovah’s promises, not blind superstition, as Hebrews 11:6 states: 'Without faith it is impossible to please God well.' False worship relies on luck or omens, like Babylonian astrology, but Bible faith rests on evidence—fulfilled prophecies and creation’s design (Romans 1:20). Historically, Noah’s faith saved his family, a pattern for us. Science marvels at the universe’s order, bolstering faith in a purposeful Creator. Faith in Jehovah’s Word offers hope beyond pagan uncertainties.", 
                description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Hope in truth.", 
                example: "<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - Without faith it is impossible.\n<b>Romans 10:17</b> - Faith follows the thing heard.\n<b>Hebrews 11:1</b> - Faith is the assured expectation." 
            },
            { 
                title: "14. What Is Baptism?", 
                instruction: "Baptism is a public symbol of dedication to Jehovah, not a ritual for infants, as Acts 2:38 commands: 'Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.' False worship sprinkles babies, a tradition from pagan rites, but the Bible requires conscious faith and full immersion (Matthew 3:16). Historically, early Christians baptized believers, not newborns. Science shows immersion’s symbolism—death to sin, new life—mirrors natural cycles. Baptism marks true worshipers committed to Jehovah.", 
                description: "<b>Fact:</b> Conscious decision.", 
                example: "<b>Acts 2:38</b> - Repent, and be baptized.\n<b>Matthew 3:16</b> - Jesus came up from the water.\n<b>Acts 8:36</b> - What prevents me from getting baptized?" 
            },
            { 
                title: "15. Why Obey God?", 
                instruction: "Obedience to Jehovah reflects love and brings blessings, as 1 John 5:3 explains: 'This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.' False worship follows human rules or lax morality, like pagan permissiveness, but the Bible ties obedience to life (Deuteronomy 11:27). Historically, Israel prospered when obedient, a lesson for today. Science links discipline to well-being, echoing Jehovah’s laws. Obeying Him ensures protection from false paths.", 
                description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Blessings from God.", 
                example: "<b>1 John 5:3</b> - This is what the love of God means.\n<b>Deuteronomy 11:27</b> - Blessing if you listen.\n<b>John 14:15</b> - If you love me, observe my commandments." 
            },
            { 
                title: "16. What Is Love?", 
                instruction: "Love mirrors Jehovah’s nature, a selfless action, not mere emotion, as 1 John 4:8 declares: 'God is love.' False worship distorts love into lust or ritual, like pagan fertility cults, but the Bible defines it through sacrifice—Jesus’ death (John 3:16). Historically, early Christians showed love by sharing all things (Acts 2:44-45). Science links love to health, reflecting Jehovah’s design. True love honors Him, not worldly desires.", 
                description: "<b>Fact:</b> Love is action.", 
                example: "<b>1 John 4:8</b> - God is love.\n<b>John 3:16</b> - God gave his only-begotten Son.\n<b>1 Corinthians 13:4</b> - Love is patient and kind." 
            },
            { 
                title: "17. Why Be Honest?", 
                instruction: "Honesty reflects Jehovah’s truthfulness, as Ephesians 4:25 urges: 'Speak truth each one of you with his neighbor.' False worship thrives on deceit, like pagan oracles’ vague lies, but the Bible demands integrity. Historically, honest dealings marked God’s servants, like Joseph in Egypt. Science shows trust builds societies, aligning with Jehovah’s principles. Honesty honors Him, rejecting falsehood’s corruption.", 
                description: "<b>Benefit:</b> Reflects God’s character.", 
                example: "<b>Ephesians 4:25</b> - Speak truth with his neighbor.\n<b>Proverbs 12:22</b> - Lying lips are detestable.\n<b>Psalm 15:2</b> - Speaking the truth in his heart." 
            },
            {

        title: "78. What Is the Paradise Earth?", 
        instruction: "The paradise earth is Jehovah’s promise of a restored planet, as Matthew 5:5 declares: 'Happy are the mild-tempered, for they will inherit the earth.' False worship envisions heaven or reincarnation, like Hindu cycles, but the Bible restores Eden’s perfection—peace among animals and humans (Isaiah 11:6). Historically, this hope sustained faithful ones like Abraham. Science marvels at earth’s life-supporting design, hinting at Jehovah’s intent to renew it, not abandon it to pagan chaos.", 
        description: "<b>Future:</b> Perfect earth.", 
        example: "<b>Matthew 5:5</b> - Meek will inherit the earth.\n<b>Isaiah 11:6</b> - Wolf will reside with lamb.\n<b>Revelation 21:4</b> - Death will be no more." 
    },
    { 
        title: "79. Why No Blood Transfusions?", 
        instruction: "Blood is sacred to Jehovah, reserved for atonement, as Acts 15:29 commands: 'Keep abstaining from... blood.' False worship profanes it, like pagan blood-drinking rites, but the Bible upholds its sanctity from Noah’s day (Genesis 9:4). Historically, early Christians died rather than violate this law. Science offers alternatives like saline, affirming Jehovah’s wisdom over human fixes that defy His will.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> God’s law on blood.", 
        example: "<b>Acts 15:29</b> - Abstain from blood.\n<b>Genesis 9:4</b> - Flesh with its blood you must not eat.\n<b>Leviticus 17:14</b> - Blood is the life." 
    },
    { 
        title: "80. What Is the Faithful Slave?", 
        instruction: "The faithful slave is a group appointed by Jesus to provide spiritual food, as Matthew 24:45 asks: 'Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics?' False worship elevates clergy, like pagan priests, but the Bible assigns this role to humble servants guiding God’s people (Luke 12:42). Historically, this began with the apostles and matured in the last days, post-1914. Science can’t replicate divine truth, but Jehovah’s provision sustains His flock.", 
        description: "<b>Role:</b> Spiritual leadership.", 
        example: "<b>Matthew 24:45</b> - Faithful and discreet slave.\n<b>Luke 12:42</b> - Faithful steward.\n<b>John 21:17</b> - Feed my little sheep." 
    },
    { 
        title: "81. Why No Political Involvement?", 
        instruction: "Jehovah’s servants stay neutral in politics, as John 17:16 states: 'They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.' False worship entangles with power, like Rome’s state religion, but the Bible pledges loyalty to God’s Kingdom alone (John 18:36). Historically, early Christians refused civic duties conflicting with faith. Science shows politics divide, while Jehovah’s rule unites.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Kingdom focus.", 
        example: "<b>John 17:16</b> - No part of this world.\n<b>John 18:36</b> - My Kingdom is not of this world.\n<b>James 4:4</b> - Friendship with the world is enmity." 
    },
    { 
        title: "82. What Is the Last Days?", 
        instruction: "The last days are a critical period before Jehovah’s intervention, as 2 Timothy 3:1 warns: 'In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.' False worship dismisses signs, like pagan optimism, but the Bible lists wars, moral decay, and preaching as proof (Matthew 24:6-7). Historically, these began intensifying in 1914, per prophecy. Science notes global crises, aligning with Jehovah’s timeline.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Signs evident.", 
        example: "<b>2 Timothy 3:1</b> - Critical times hard to deal with.\n<b>Matthew 24:6-7</b> - Wars and famines.\n<b>2 Peter 3:3</b> - Scoffers in the last days." 
    },
    { 
        title: "83. Why No Hellfire?", 
        instruction: "Hellfire is a myth, not Jehovah’s justice, as Ecclesiastes 9:5 states: 'The dead know nothing at all.' False worship, from Babylonian fire gods, torments souls, but the Bible teaches death’s sleep (Psalm 37:20). Historically, early Christians rejected eternal torture. Science confirms consciousness ends, proving Jehovah’s love over pagan fear.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Grave, not fire.", 
        example: "<b>Ecclesiastes 9:5</b> - Dead know nothing.\n<b>Psalm 37:20</b> - Wicked will vanish.\n<b>Romans 6:7</b> - He who has died has been acquitted." 
    },
    { 
        title: "84. What Is Everlasting Life?", 
        instruction: "Everlasting life is Jehovah’s gift through Christ, as Romans 6:23 promises: 'The gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.' False worship seeks it via reincarnation or rituals, like Egyptian mummification, but the Bible offers it on a paradise earth or heaven (John 17:3). Historically, this hope drove faithful ones like Job. Science can’t grant eternity, but Jehovah’s Word does.", 
        description: "<b>Hope:</b> Eternal living.", 
        example: "<b>Romans 6:23</b> - Gift is everlasting life.\n<b>John 17:3</b> - Taking in knowledge of God.\n<b>Psalm 37:29</b> - Righteous will live forever." 
    },
    { 
        title: "85. Why No Trinity?", 
        instruction: "The Trinity contradicts Jehovah’s oneness, as John 14:28 states: 'The Father is greater than I am.' False worship adopted it from pagan triads, like Babylon’s, but the Bible upholds one God (Mark 12:29). Historically, it emerged post-apostles, not from Jesus. Science finds no three-in-one logic, affirming Jehovah’s singular truth.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> One God.", 
        example: "<b>John 14:28</b> - The Father is greater.\n<b>Mark 12:29</b> - Jehovah our God is one.\n<b>1 Corinthians 11:3</b> - Head of Christ is God." 
    },
    { 
        title: "86. What Is the Anointed?", 
        instruction: "The anointed are the 144,000 chosen to rule with Christ, as Revelation 7:4 states: 'The number of those who were sealed, 144,000.' False worship universalizes salvation, like pagan afterlife myths, but the Bible reserves this heavenly role for a few (Romans 8:17). Historically, their selection began post-33 C.E. Science can’t fathom their destiny, but Jehovah’s purpose is clear.", 
        description: "<b>Role:</b> Co-rulers with Christ.", 
        example: "<b>Revelation 7:4</b> - 144,000 sealed.\n<b>Romans 8:17</b> - Joint heirs with Christ.\n<b>2 Timothy 2:12</b> - Reign with him." 
    },
    { 
        title: "87. Why No Immortal Soul?", 
        instruction: "The soul isn’t immortal, as Genesis 3:19 states: 'To dust you will return.' False worship, from Greek shades to Hindu atman, claims eternal life, but the Bible teaches death’s end (Ezekiel 18:4). Historically, Israel rejected afterlife myths. Science confirms consciousness ceases, aligning with Jehovah’s resurrection hope.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Death ends consciousness.", 
        example: "<b>Genesis 3:19</b> - To dust you will return.\n<b>Ezekiel 18:4</b> - Soul who sins will die.\n<b>Psalm 146:4</b> - His thoughts perish." 
    },
    { 
        title: "88. What Is the Great Crowd?", 
        instruction: "The great crowd survives Armageddon for earthly life, as Revelation 7:9 describes: 'A great crowd... out of all nations.' False worship expects heaven for all, like universalist myths, but the Bible gives them paradise (Psalm 37:11). Historically, this hope emerged clearly in the last days. Science can’t predict survival, but Jehovah’s promise stands.", 
        description: "<b>Future:</b> Live on earth.", 
        example: "<b>Revelation 7:9</b> - A great crowd out of all nations.\n<b>Revelation 7:14</b> - Come out of tribulation.\n<b>Psalm 37:11</b> - Meek will possess the earth." 
    },
    { 
        title: "89. Why No Cross?", 
        instruction: "Jesus died on a stake, not a cross, as Acts 2:23 states: 'You fastened him to a stake.' False worship adopted the cross from pagan symbols, like Egypt’s ankh, but the Bible uses ‘stauros’—a pole (Galatians 3:13). Historically, early Christians didn’t use crosses. Science traces its pagan roots, affirming Jehovah’s truth.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Historical accuracy.", 
        example: "<b>Acts 2:23</b> - Nailed to the stake.\n<b>Galatians 3:13</b> - Hung on a stake.\n<b>Deuteronomy 21:23</b> - Hung on a tree." 
    },
    { 
        title: "90. What Is the Day of Jehovah?", 
        instruction: "The Day of Jehovah is His judgment on wickedness, as Joel 2:11 warns: 'The day of Jehovah is great and very awe-inspiring.' False worship fears random doom, like pagan end-times, but the Bible targets evil (2 Peter 3:10). Historically, past judgments like Sodom’s prefigure it. Science notes earth’s fragility, but Jehovah’s day renews it.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> God’s intervention.", 
        example: "<b>Joel 2:11</b> - Great and fear-inspiring day.\n<b>Zephaniah 1:14</b> - Day of Jehovah is near.\n<b>2 Peter 3:10</b> - Day will come as a thief." 
    },
    { 
        title: "91. Why No Pagan Holidays?", 
        instruction: "Pagan holidays defy Jehovah, as Jeremiah 10:2 commands: 'Do not learn the way of the nations.' False worship blends them with truth, like Christmas from Saturnalia, but the Bible rejects such customs (2 Corinthians 6:17). Historically, faithful ones shunned these post-apostles. Science traces their origins, not Jehovah’s will.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Unscriptural origins.", 
        example: "<b>Jeremiah 10:2</b> - Do not learn the way.\n<b>2 Corinthians 6:17</b> - Separate yourselves.\n<b>Colossians 2:8</b> - Traditions of men." 
    },
    { 
        title: "92. What Is the Final Test?", 
        instruction: "The final test follows Satan’s release after 1,000 years, as Revelation 20:3 states: 'He should be released for a little while.' False worship expects endless trials, like pagan cycles, but the Bible proves loyalty once (Revelation 20:7-8). Historically, tests like Job’s foreshadow it. Science can’t foresee it, but Jehovah’s plan ensures justice.", 
        description: "<b>Future:</b> After 1,000 years.", 
        example: "<b>Revelation 20:3</b> - Released for a little while.\n<b>Revelation 20:7-8</b> - Satan released to mislead.\n<b>1 Corinthians 15:24</b> - End when he hands over Kingdom." 
    },
    { 
        title: "93. Why No Reincarnation?", 
        instruction: "Reincarnation is false, as Hebrews 9:27 states: 'It is reserved for men to die once for all time.' False worship, like Hindu samsara, recycles souls, but the Bible promises resurrection (John 5:28-29). Historically, Israel rejected such myths. Science shows life’s uniqueness, aligning with Jehovah’s one-death truth.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> One life, then judgment.", 
        example: "<b>Hebrews 9:27</b> - Appointed to die once.\n<b>John 5:28-29</b> - Tombs will come out.\n<b>Ecclesiastes 9:5</b> - Dead know nothing." 
    },
    { 
        title: "94. What Is the Millennium?", 
        instruction: "The Millennium is Christ’s 1,000-year reign to restore earth, as Revelation 20:4 states: 'They came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for 1,000 years.' False worship envisions chaos, like pagan end-times, but the Bible promises peace (Isaiah 65:20). Historically, it follows Armageddon. Science sees earth’s potential, reflecting Jehovah’s renewal.", 
        description: "<b>Future:</b> Peace for 1,000 years.", 
        example: "<b>Revelation 20:4</b> - Ruled for 1,000 years.\n<b>Isaiah 65:20</b> - No more infant dying.\n<b>Revelation 20:6</b> - Priests for 1,000 years." 
    },
    { 
        title: "95. Why No Materialism?", 
        instruction: "Materialism distracts from Jehovah, as Matthew 6:24 warns: 'You cannot slave for God and for Riches.' False worship idolizes wealth, like Mammon cults, but the Bible teaches spiritual riches (1 Timothy 6:10). Historically, greed ruined nations like Babylon. Science links it to misery, proving Jehovah’s way brings true contentment.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Focus on spiritual riches.", 
        example: "<b>Matthew 6:24</b> - Cannot slave for God and Riches.\n<b>1 Timothy 6:10</b> - Love of money a root.\n<b>Luke 12:34</b> - Where your treasure is." 
    },
    { 
        title: "96. What Is the Second Death?", 
        instruction: "The second death is eternal destruction, as Revelation 20:14 states: 'This means the second death, the lake of fire.' False worship fears endless torment, like pagan hells, but the Bible ends rebellion permanently (Matthew 10:28). Historically, it’s post-Millennium judgment. Science can’t undo death, but Jehovah’s justice prevails.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Final end.", 
        example: "<b>Revelation 20:14</b> - Second death, the lake of fire.\n<b>Revelation 21:8</b> - Their portion in the lake.\n<b>Matthew 10:28</b> - Destroy both soul and body." 
    },
    { 
        title: "97. Why No Evolution?", 
        instruction: "Evolution denies Jehovah’s creation, as Genesis 2:3 states: 'God proceeded to bless the seventh day... because on it he had been resting from all his work.' False worship credits chance, like Darwinism, but the Bible affirms design (Psalm 139:14). Historically, creation stood against pagan myths. Science marvels at DNA’s complexity, pointing to Jehovah, not random processes.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> God is Creator.", 
        example: "<b>Genesis 2:3</b> - God made them all.\n<b>Psalm 139:14</b> - Wonderfully made.\n<b>Romans 1:20</b> - Qualities seen in creation." 
    },
    { 
        title: "98. What Is True Worship?", 
        instruction: "True worship honors Jehovah alone, as John 4:24 states: 'God is a Spirit, and those worshipping him must worship with spirit and truth.' False worship mixes lies, like pagan syncretism, but the Bible demands purity (Matthew 4:10). Historically, faithful ones like Daniel stood firm. Science can’t define worship, but Jehovah’s Word does.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Based on Scripture.", 
        example: "<b>John 4:24</b> - Worship with spirit and truth.\n<b>Matthew 4:10</b> - Jehovah your God worship.\n<b>Psalm 83:18</b> - Jehovah alone Most High." 
    },
    { 
        title: "99. Why No Fear of Man?", 
        instruction: "Fear belongs to Jehovah, not man, as Matthew 10:28 states: 'Do not become fearful of those who kill the body.' False worship cowers to rulers, like pagan tyrants, but the Bible trusts God’s protection (Proverbs 29:25). Historically, martyrs like Stephen defied man. Science shows fear’s limits, while Jehovah’s power endures.", 
        description: "<b>Fact:</b> Trust in Jehovah.", 
        example: "<b>Matthew 10:28</b> - Do not fear those who kill.\n<b>Proverbs 29:25</b> - Fear of man is a snare.\n<b>Isaiah 51:12</b> - Why fear mortal man?" 
    },
    { 
        title: "100. What Is the Reward?", 
        instruction: "The reward is everlasting life for the faithful, as Hebrews 11:6 states: 'He becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.' False worship seeks fleeting gains, like pagan riches, but the Bible offers eternity (Revelation 22:14). Historically, this hope drove Noah and others. Science can’t grant life, but Jehovah’s promise fulfills all.", 
        description: "<b>Hope:</b> Everlasting life.", 
        example: "<b>Hebrews 11:6</b> - He becomes the rewarder.\n<b>Revelation 22:14</b> - Right to the trees of life.\n<b>Psalm 37:29</b> - Righteous will live forever."
