                        <p class="scripture">“But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.” —Genesis 2:17</p>
                        <p>This scripture establishes Jehovah’s sovereignty and the penalty for disobedience. Jehovah gave Adam a clear command, showing His right to set standards. The consequence—death, not eternal torment—refutes hellfire, as Ezekiel 18:4 confirms (“the soul who sins will die”). Satan’s lie (Genesis 3:4) introduced sin, which Jehovah’s Kingdom will undo (Romans 5:12). Jehovah’s Witnesses use this to explain why death is sin’s wages, not eternal suffering, when preaching about resurrection hope (John 5:28-29). Apply it by obeying Jehovah’s laws, like avoiding immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18), to gain everlasting life. Share this to counter myths about the soul’s immortality, emphasizing Jehovah’s just punishment and paradise promise (Psalm 37:29).</p>

                        <p class="scripture">“And I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring. He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.” —Genesis 3:15</p>
                        <p>The first Bible prophecy foretells Jehovah’s victory over Satan. The “woman” is God’s heavenly organization, her “offspring” is Jesus, and Satan’s “offspring” includes his followers (John 8:44). Jesus’ death and resurrection struck Satan’s fatal blow (Revelation 20:10). Jehovah’s Witnesses use this to explain the battle between good and evil, showing why Satan tempts humans (1 Peter 5:8). It’s key in preaching to highlight Jehovah’s purpose to restore paradise (Revelation 21:4). Apply it by resisting Satan’s influence, like materialism, trusting Jehovah’s promise. Use it to show how Jehovah’s Kingdom will crush evil, offering hope for a righteous world (Psalm 37:10-11).</p>

                        <p class="scripture">“Only flesh with its life—its blood—you must not eat.” —Genesis 9:4</p>
                        <p>Given to Noah, this underscores blood’s sanctity, reflecting Jehovah’s view of life (Leviticus 17:11). Jehovah’s Witnesses apply it to refuse blood transfusions, obeying Acts 15:29’s directive to “abstain from blood.” It counters medical practices disregarding Jehovah’s law, emphasizing trust in His standards. In preaching, explain why Witnesses choose alternatives, showing respect for life (Psalm 36:9). Apply it by honoring Jehovah in health decisions. Pair with Leviticus 17:14 to clarify blood’s role, reinforcing Jehovah’s principles and hope for perfect health in paradise (Isaiah 35:5-6).</p>

                        <p class="scripture">“So God said to Moses: ‘I Will Become What I Choose to Become.’ And he added: ‘This is what you are to say to the Israelites, “I Will Become has sent me to you.”’” —Exodus 3:14</p>
                        <p>This reveals Jehovah’s eternal existence and dynamic nature. Unlike the mistranslated “I Am,” the NWT clarifies His sovereignty. Jehovah’s Witnesses use it to affirm Jehovah as Creator, distinct from false gods (Isaiah 42:8). It’s key to correct Trinitarian errors, showing Jehovah’s identity (Psalm 83:18). Apply it by trusting Jehovah’s power to meet needs, as He did for Israel (Exodus 15:2). Use it to highlight Jehovah’s name and role, encouraging study of His paradise promises (Isaiah 55:11).</p>

                        <p>Jehovah emphasizes His name, marking a deeper relationship with His people. Jehovah’s Witnesses stress using Jehovah’s name, unlike Christendom’s removal of it (Psalm 83:18). It refutes claims that God’s name is unimportant (John 17:26). In preaching, encourage using Jehovah’s name, as Jesus did (Matthew 6:9). Apply it by proclaiming Jehovah’s name boldly. Pair with Isaiah 42:8 to show exclusive devotion, offering salvation hope (Joel 2:32).</p>

                        <p>After the Red Sea deliverance, this exalts Jehovah’s power and name. Jehovah’s Witnesses use it to affirm His sovereignty and protection, as shown against Pharaoh (Exodus 14:14). It counters teachings diminishing Jehovah’s might (Isaiah 40:26). In preaching, inspire confidence in Jehovah’s victory at Armageddon (Revelation 16:16). Apply it by trusting Jehovah’s protection (Psalm 27:1). Highlight Jehovah’s name and power, showing His Kingdom will defeat evil (Psalm 37:10).</p>

                        <p class="scripture">“You must not have any other gods besides me.” —Exodus 20:3</p>
                        <p>The first Commandment demands exclusive devotion to Jehovah, rejecting false gods. Jehovah’s Witnesses use it to refute polytheism and the Trinity, which equates Jesus with Jehovah (John 17:3). Given at Sinai (1513 BCE), it set Israel apart (1 Kings 18:21). In preaching, expose false worship using images or saints (John 4:23). Apply it by avoiding idols like materialism (Matthew 6:33). Emphasize Jehovah’s sovereignty, showing true worship leads to paradise (Psalm 37:29).</p>

You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them, because I, Jehovah your God, am a God who requires exclusive devotion.” —Exodus 20:4-5</p>
                        <p>This forbids idolatry, condemning images in worship, as in Catholicism’s statues. Jehovah’s Witnesses expose pagan practices echoing Babylonian idolatry (2000 BCE) (Isaiah 42:8). In preaching, urge rejecting idols, including nationalism (1 John 5:21). Apply it by keeping worship pure, avoiding subtle idolatry like wealth (Colossians 3:5). Pair with John 4:23 to show spiritual worship, offering hope for a paradise free of false religion (Revelation 18:4).</p>

                        <p>Jehovah’s jealous love demands pure worship, forbidding rival gods. Jehovah’s Witnesses use it to refute Christendom’s false doctrines, like venerating saints (John 17:3). Given during Israel’s covenant renewal, it emphasizes Jehovah’s intolerance of idolatry (Deuteronomy 6:14-15). In preaching, expose false worship (John 4:23). Apply it by prioritizing Jehovah over worldly pursuits (Matthew 6:33). Use it to show exclusive devotion leads to everlasting life (Psalm 37:29).</p>

                        <p>This underscores blood’s sacredness, used for atonement, not consumption. Jehovah’s Witnesses apply it to refuse transfusions, per Acts 15:29, honoring life (Genesis 9:4). It counters medical practices ignoring Jehovah’s law (Psalm 36:9). In preaching, explain alternative treatments, showing respect for Jehovah’s standards. Apply it in health decisions, trusting Jehovah’s wisdom. Use with Leviticus 17:14 to clarify blood’s role, offering hope for perfect health (Isaiah 35:5-6).</p>

                        <p>The Shema affirms Jehovah’s oneness, refuting the Trinity (John 17:3). Jehovah’s Witnesses use it to emphasize exclusive worship, as Moses taught Israel (1513 BCE). It counters polytheism and Christendom’s false gods (Isaiah 42:8). In preaching, highlight Jehovah’s unique identity (Psalm 83:18). Apply it by loving Jehovah wholeheartedly, avoiding divided loyalty (Matthew 22:37). Use it to show Jehovah’s singularity, promising paradise for true worshippers (Psalm 37:29).</p>

For whoever does these things is detestable to Jehovah.” —Deuteronomy 18:10-12</p>
                        <p>This condemns spiritism, from divination to mediums, as detestable. Jehovah’s Witnesses use it to avoid occult practices, like horoscopes or séances, common in false religions (1 Corinthians 10:20-21). Given to Israel, it protected them from Canaanite paganism. In preaching, warn against spiritism’s dangers, urging Bible study (John 17:17). Apply it by shunning entertainment with occult themes (Ephesians 5:11). Use it to show Jehovah’s hatred of Satan’s works, promising a clean paradise (Revelation 21:8).</p>

                        <p>Moses urged Israel to choose life by obeying Jehovah. Jehovah’s Witnesses use it to emphasize free will and the choice to serve Jehovah (Joshua 24:15). It’s key in preaching to urge others to choose truth over false worship (John 4:23). Apply it by making daily choices aligning with Jehovah’s standards (Psalm 119:105).

                        <p>Joshua’s bold choice to serve Jehovah inspires resolute worship. Jehovah’s Witnesses use it to urge choosing Jehovah over false gods or worldly pursuits (Deuteronomy 30:19). Spoken before Israel’s conquest (1473 BCE), it emphasizes loyalty.
