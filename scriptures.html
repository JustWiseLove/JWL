                <p class="scripture">“But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.”</p>
                <p>This verse reveals Jehovah’s sovereign authority to define right and wrong. Spoken to Adam in Eden, it establishes obedience as the foundation of life. Eating the forbidden fruit brought death, not eternal torment, proving the soul is mortal and refuting Satan’s lie of immortality. This means humans inherit sin and death, but Jehovah’s purpose offers restoration through His Kingdom. To gain everlasting life, reject worldly rebellion and live by Jehovah’s standards, avoiding immorality and falsehoods. Proclaim this truth boldly, warning others of disobedience’s penalty. Study Jehovah’s Word to discern His will, and choose righteousness over temptation. Hesitation aligns with Satan’s deception, leading to destruction. This verse demands immediate loyalty to Jehovah’s commands, securing your place in paradise where death will cease. Choose Jehovah’s way now to inherit eternal life.</p>

                <p>This verse unveils Jehovah’s plan to defeat Satan. Spoken after Adam’s sin, it foretells conflict between Satan’s forces and Jehovah’s heavenly organization, with Jesus as the offspring who crushes Satan’s head. This means Jehovah guarantees victory over evil through Jesus’ ransom, nullifying Satan’s power. Satan’s strike—Jesus’ death—was temporary, as Jehovah raised him. This truth exposes Satan’s fleeting rule and Jehovah’s unstoppable purpose for a paradise earth. Dedicate yourself to proclaiming this victory, resisting temptations like materialism. Study Jehovah’s Word to strengthen faith, and share this hope to awaken others. Choosing Jehovah’s side ensures everlasting life under His Kingdom, where evil will vanish.
