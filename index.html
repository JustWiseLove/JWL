                        <p>Satan, “the ruler of this world,” dangles temporary satisfaction—wealth, status, and fleeting pleasures—to lure people from Jehovah (John 12:31). His system, born from Eve’s deception, promises quick thrills but ends in emptiness, leaving only regret and ruin.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” —1 John 5:19</p>

                        <p>Jehovah offers everlasting results through divine wisdom. His Word rejects short-lived gains for righteousness and peace, guiding us to a purpose that endures beyond this life. Satan’s world fades; Jehovah’s truth lasts forever.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.” —Proverbs 9:10</p>

                        <p>Satan’s temptations—like riches or instant gratification—sparkle briefly but crumble (1 John 2:16). The Bible calls his world temporary, doomed to pass away, while Jehovah builds a Kingdom where the faithful thrive eternally (Psalm 37:29). Choosing temporary satisfaction over everlasting life is a lie Satan sells.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The world is passing away and so is its desire, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.” —1 John 2:17</p>

                        <p>Jehovah’s way demands effort but yields unending rewards. Jesus spurned Satan’s fleeting offers, standing firm for truth (Matthew 4:10). We must too, picking everlasting results over temporary fixes, securing joy in a paradise Satan can’t touch.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</p>

                        <p>Satan’s world tempts with instant highs; Jehovah promises a lasting future. The choice ties to truth—stand for Jehovah’s everlasting Kingdom or fall for Satan’s fleeting lies. Only one path leads to a world where peace reigns forever.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.” —Psalm 37:11</p>

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>Worshiping Jehovah in truth is essential for everlasting life. The Bible warns that false worship, even with good intentions, leads to ruin, as seen with the Israelites and echoed in today’s practices.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must not have any other gods besides me.” —Exodus 20:3</p>

                        <p>The Israelites turned to pagan gods, like the golden calf, claiming it honored Jehovah (Exodus 32:4-6). God judged it idolatry, and thousands perished (Exodus 32:28). They later served Baal, offering children in fire (Jeremiah 19:5), a practice so vile that many died in the wilderness, never reaching the Promised Land (Numbers 14:29-30). Their error was blending pagan traditions with worship, defying Jehovah’s command.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They went mixing with the nations and learned their works.” —Psalm 106:35</p>

                        <p>Today, false worship thrives in traditions masquerading as faith. Christmas, tied to December 25, stems from Saturnalia, a Roman festival honoring the sun god Saturn, with trees and gift-giving rooted in pagan rituals—not Jesus’ birth, which the Bible doesn’t date. Easter mixes resurrection with fertility rites, like eggs and rabbits, linked to the goddess Eostre, not Scripture. The Trinity, a cornerstone for many, isn’t biblical—John 17:3 calls Jehovah “the only true God,” distinct from Jesus, yet it mirrors pagan triads from Babylon and Egypt. Birthdays, celebrated universally, originate in spiritism and astrology, with candles and wishes tied to ancient magic, not God’s approval.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Get out from among them, and separate yourselves... and quit touching the unclean thing.” —2 Corinthians 6:17</p>

                        <p>Going to church isn’t enough if we cling to these falsehoods. The Israelites believed in God yet fell; today, many profess faith but follow pagan-rooted customs, risking paradise. True worship requires rejecting these and seeking Jehovah’s truth in the Bible. Joshua and Caleb obeyed and entered Canaan (Joshua 14:6-9), showing that following Jehovah’s standards leads to life.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</p>

                        <p>Exploring truth means abandoning false worship for Jehovah’s way. The Bible promises a paradise where “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11), but only for those who worship “in spirit and truth” (John 4:23-24). Choosing truth over tradition secures a future where Jehovah’s will reigns (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.” —Isaiah 11:9</p>

        <h1>Satan Owns The Fence</h1>

        <h2>No Middle Ground</h2>
        <p>The Bible leaves no room for indecision: if you don’t stand for Jehovah’s truth, you’ll fall for Satan’s lies. Sitting on the fence isn’t neutral—it’s a victory for the “father of the lie” (John 8:44). Satan thrives when people waver, offering a world of half-truths that lead to destruction.</p>
        <p class="scripture">“So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of my mouth.” —Revelation 3:16</p>

        <h2>Historical Proof</h2>
        <p>The Israelites tried to straddle both sides. They kept Jehovah’s name but bowed to Baal, burning incense to idols (2 Kings 17:16-17). Their compromise didn’t save them—God exiled them from the land (2 Kings 17:23). Refusing to fully reject lies cost them everything, proving Satan claims those who don’t choose truth.</p>
        <p class="scripture">“They exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the Creator.” —Romans 1:25</p>

        <h2>Modern Fences</h2>
        <p>Today, many sit on the fence, blending faith with Satan’s world. They pray to Jehovah but celebrate Christmas, a pagan sun-worship rite, or Easter, tied to fertility gods. They nod to the Trinity, a lie from Babylon, and blow out birthday candles, a ritual from spiritism. These aren’t harmless—they’re footh ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
