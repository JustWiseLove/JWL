            <summary>Finding Jehovah’s Truth</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Your Word Is Truth</h2>
                <p>In a world filled with lies and confusion, can we really find truth? Yes, we can—because Jehovah, the God of truth, has given us his Word, the Bible. Jesus prayed to his Father, saying, “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). The Bible is not a collection of human opinions; it is Jehovah’s inspired message, reliable and factual. Through it, we learn about his purpose for us—a future of peace and life on a paradise earth.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.” <cite>—John 17:17</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Jesus Is the Truth</h2>
                <p>Jesus Christ, Jehovah’s Son, lived and spoke the truth. He boldly declared, “I am the way and the truth and the life” (John 14:6). Jesus didn’t just teach truth—he embodied it. His life showed us how to please Jehovah, and his teachings guide us to everlasting life. By following Jesus’ example and trusting his sacrifice, we draw closer to the God who sent him.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Jesus said to him: ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’” <cite>—John 14:6</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Worship the Father in Truth</h2>
                <p>Jehovah deserves our worship, but it must be based on truth. Jesus explained, “The true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth” (John 4:23). This means rejecting false beliefs and traditions, like the Trinity or the immortality of the soul, and embracing what the Bible really teaches. True worshippers unite worldwide, honoring Jehovah as the only true God.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for indeed, the Father is looking for ones like these to worship him.” <cite>—John 4:23</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Searching for Truth</h2>
                <p>Finding truth sets us free—but it takes effort. Jesus promised, “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). This freedom comes from understanding Jehovah’s Word, not just hearing it. The Bible answers life’s big questions—like why suffering exists and how it will end. Search for truth with an open heart, and Jehovah will reveal it.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” <cite>—John 8:32</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A Foundation for Life</h2>
                <p>Truth is the starting point for a meaningful life. The Bible says, “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway” (Psalm 119:105). It guides us through a dark world, showing the path to Jehovah. Begin with truth, and it opens the door to living in harmony with God’s will.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.” <cite>—Psalm 119:105</cite>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Truth in Action</h2>
                <p>Once we find truth, we must live it. The Bible says, “The one who does the truth comes to the light” (John 3:21). This means our actions—how we treat others, speak, and work—must reflect Jehovah’s standards. Living truthfully proves our love for God and draws us closer to him.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “But the one who does the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be made evident as having been done in harmony with God.” <cite>—John 3:21</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Integrity Matters</h2>
                <p>Living the truth requires integrity. Psalm 26:1 says, “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in my integrity.” Even when it’s hard—like refusing to lie or cheat—we stay loyal to Jehovah’s principles. This builds a reputation as his faithful servants.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in my integrity; in Jehovah I have trusted without wavering.” <cite>—Psalm 26:1</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Speaking Truth</h2>
                <p>Our words must align with truth. Ephesians 4:25 urges us to “speak truth with his neighbor.” This means avoiding gossip, exaggeration, or deceit, even in small things. Honest speech honors Jehovah and strengthens our relationships.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Therefore, now that you have put away deceit, each one of you speak truth with his neighbor, because we are members belonging to one another.” <cite>—Ephesians 4:25</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Endurance Through Trials</h2>
                <p>Living the truth isn’t always easy. Jesus warned, “In the world you will have tribulation” (John 16:33). But by holding to Jehovah’s truth, we gain courage to face opposition or hardship, knowing he supports us through every trial.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “In the world you will have tribulation, but take courage! I have conquered the world.” <cite>—John 16:33</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A Life of Purpose</h2>
                <p>Living the truth gives life meaning. Colossians 1:10 encourages us to “go on walking worthily of Jehovah.” Every step in truth—whether in family life, work, or worship—brings us joy and prepares us to value it forever.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “So that you may go on walking worthily of Jehovah in order to please him fully as you continue bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God.” <cite>—Colossians 1:10</cite>

            <summary>Valuing Jehovah’s Truth</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Truth Is Priceless</h2>
                <p>Proverbs 23:23 urges us to "buy truth and never sell it." Truth from Jehovah is a treasure worth more than gold. It’s not a casual suggestion—it’s a command to seek what lasts. This truth isn’t found in human ideas or shifting opinions. It’s hidden in God’s Word, waiting for those who dig deep. Crave real answers? Hunt for it now, because it unlocks everlasting life.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Buy truth and do not sell it—wisdom and discipline and understanding.” <cite>—Proverbs 23:23</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>The Source of Truth</h2>
                <p>Jehovah is the God of truth. His Word, the Bible, is where we find it. Jesus said, “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Unlike the world’s lies that fade, Jehovah’s truth endures forever. It’s not cheap—it costs effort, time, and humility to uncover. But once you grasp it, no price is too high. Search for it like hidden treasure, because it leads to life.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.” <cite>—John 17:17</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Digging for Treasure</h2>
                <p>Finding truth takes work. Proverbs 2:4-5 says to seek it “as for hidden treasures.” That means studying the Bible, not just skimming it. Jehovah reveals his purpose—his Kingdom, the end of suffering, a paradise earth—to those who search. The world offers distractions, but they’re worthless compared to this. Dig in now; the reward is knowing Jehovah and his Son.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “If you search for it as for silver, and you seek it as for hidden treasures, then you will understand the fear of Jehovah, and you will find the knowledge of God.” <cite>—Proverbs 2:4-5</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Never Sell It</h2>
                <p>Once you have Jehovah’s truth, hold it tight. The world tempts us to trade it for money, approval, or ease. But Jesus warned, “What will a man give in exchange for his life?” (Matthew 16:26). Truth is your lifeline to God’s promises—don’t let it go. It’s the foundation for living with purpose now and forever.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “For what will it benefit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?” <cite>—Matthew 16:26</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>The Reward of Truth</h2>
                <p>Truth isn’t just knowledge—it’s power. It frees you from lies and fear. It shows the way to everlasting life. Jesus said, “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ” (John 17:3). Buy it now. Study. Pray. Act. Jehovah’s truth is the treasure that never fails.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” <cite>—John 17:3</cite>

            <summary>Origins of False Worship</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Ancient Rebellion</h2>
                <p>False worship began with rebellion against Jehovah. After the Flood, Nimrod, a mighty hunter “in opposition to Jehovah,” built Babel to defy God’s command to spread out (Genesis 10:9-10). His tower symbolized human pride, leading to false religion that spread worldwide.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “He was a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah. That is why there is a saying: ‘Just like Nimrod, a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah.’” <cite>—Genesis 10:9</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Pagan Gods Emerge</h2>
                <p>From Babel, false worship spawned pagan gods. Babylonians revered Marduk, a war god, with temples and sacrifices, rejecting Jehovah’s sovereignty. This idolatry infected nations, as people crafted gods from wood and stone, blind to the Creator.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands.” <cite>—Psalm 115:4</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Mixing Truth with Lies</h2>
                <p>Israel fell into false worship by blending Jehovah’s law with pagan rites. King Solomon built altars for Molech, a god demanding child sacrifice (1 Kings 11:7). This compromise angered Jehovah, showing how false religion corrupts even the faithful.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the detestable god of Moab, ... and for Molech, the detestable god of the sons of Ammon.” <cite>—1 Kings 11:7</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A Legacy of Confusion</h2>
                <p>False worship’s roots spread confusion. Egypt’s Osiris and Isis myths inspired trinities across cultures, later influencing apostate Christianity. These lies buried Jehovah’s truth, making it hard for sincere ones to find him amidst the clutter of false gods.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “For they have turned their back to me and not their face.” <cite>—Jeremiah 2:27</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Judgment on Falsehood</h2>
                <p>Jehovah condemned false worship. He destroyed Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. because its people chased idols (2 Chronicles 36:17-19). History proves false religion leads to ruin, urging us to seek the one true God instead.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “There was no one to stop them, so they kept striking them down.” <cite>—2 Chronicles 36:17</cite>

            <summary>False Worship Today</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Pagan Festivals Persist</h2>
                <p>Modern false religion keeps pagan roots alive. Halloween, tied to Samhain, honors spirits with costumes and offerings—practices Jehovah hates (Deuteronomy 18:10-11). Billions join in, unaware they’re echoing ancient falsehoods.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “There should not be found in you anyone who ... consults a spirit medium or a fortune-teller.” <cite>—Deuteronomy 18:10-11</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Materialism as Worship</h2>
                <p>Today, many worship wealth over Jehovah. Megachurches preach prosperity gospels, promising riches for faith, twisting Jesus’ words about seeking God’s Kingdom first (Matthew 6:33). This materialism mimics ancient greed-driven cults.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You cannot slave for God and for Riches.” <cite>—Matthew 6:24</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Interfaith Deception</h2>
                <p>False religion promotes unity over truth. Interfaith movements claim all paths lead to God, defying Jehovah’s exclusive worship (Exodus 20:5). This dilutes his standards, luring people into a vague, unbiblical faith.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “I, Jehovah, am your God. ... You must not have any other gods besides me.” <cite>—Exodus 20:2-3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Moral Compromise</h2>
                <p>Many churches bless what Jehovah condemns—like immorality or war—calling it love. The Bible warns against “friendship with the world” (James 4:4), yet false religion adapts to please people, not God.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?” <cite>—James 4:4</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A Coming End</h2>
                <p>False religion faces destruction. Revelation 17:16 says nations will turn on “Babylon the Great,” the world empire of false religion. Its modern forms can’t escape Jehovah’s judgment—only truth endures.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The ten horns that you saw, and the wild beast, these will hate the prostitute and will make her devastated and naked.” <cite>—Revelation 17:16</cite>

            <summary>Fleeing False Worship</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Hear the Call</h2>
                <p>Jehovah commands us to flee false worship. Revelation 18:4 says, “Get out of her, my people,” urging escape from Babylon the Great’s lies. Staying means sharing her sins—freedom starts with heeding this call.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins.” <cite>—Revelation 18:4</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Test Your Faith</h2>
                <p>Examine your beliefs against the Bible. 1 John 4:1 warns, “Test the inspired statements” to spot falsehoods. If your worship includes unbiblical doctrines—like hellfire or immortal souls—it’s time to question and leave.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Do not believe every inspired statement, but test the inspired statements to see whether they originate with God.” <cite>—1 John 4:1</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Reject Traditions</h2>
                <p>Break free from man-made rituals. Jesus condemned traditions that void God’s Word (Mark 7:13). Ditch pagan holidays and creeds—Jehovah accepts only worship based on his truth, not human inventions.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You make the word of God invalid by your tradition that you have handed down.” <cite>—Mark 7:13</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Seek Jehovah’s People</h2>

            <summary>Satan vs Jehovah</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Satan’s Rule</h2>
                <p>The Bible identifies Satan as “the ruler of this world” who blinds people to the truth. He uses lies and distractions—wealth, power, and selfish desires—to trap humanity in a system opposed to Jehovah.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” <cite>—1 John 5:19</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Empty Promises</h2>
                <p>This world’s ways promise happiness but deliver emptiness, as people chase fleeting pleasures instead of lasting peace. Satan’s influence began when he deceived Eve, and it continues today through pride and rebellion against God’s standards.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The world is passing away and so is its desire, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.” <cite>—1 John 2:17</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Jehovah’s Wisdom</h2>
                <p>In contrast, Jehovah offers wisdom that leads to life. His Word teaches us to reject selfish ambition and pursue righteousness, humility, and love. Through the Bible, Jehovah reveals how to see through Satan’s schemes and find true purpose.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.” <cite>—Proverbs 9:10</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Strength to Resist</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s wisdom offers more than survival—it offers life without end. By studying His Word and applying it, we gain strength to resist Satan’s lures. Jesus showed this when he rejected Satan’s temptations, relying on Jehovah’s truth.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” <cite>—John 17:3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A Clear Choice</h2>
                <p>Every day, we face a choice: follow Satan’s dying world or embrace Jehovah’s living wisdom. The Bible urges us to “keep on seeking first the Kingdom” and trust Jehovah’s promises over Satan’s illusions—a future where His will prevails.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Happy is the man who finds wisdom and the man who acquires discernment; it is more precious than corals.” <cite>—Proverbs 3:13, 15</cite>

            <summary>True Worship or False</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Only One God</h2>
                <p>Worshiping Jehovah in truth is essential for everlasting life. The Bible warns that false worship, even with good intentions, leads to ruin, as seen with the Israelites and echoed in today’s practices.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You must not have any other gods besides me.” <cite>—Exodus 20:3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Israel’s Fall</h2>
                <p>The Israelites turned to pagan gods, like Baal, offering children in fire (Jeremiah 19:5). They mixed pagan traditions with Jehovah’s worship, and many died in the wilderness, never reaching the Promised Land (Numbers 14:29-30).</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “They went mixing with the nations and learned their works.” <cite>—Psalm 106:35</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Pagan Roots Today</h2>
                <p>Today, false worship thrives in traditions like Christmas, tied to Saturnalia, and Easter, linked to fertility rites—not Scripture. The Trinity mimics pagan triads, not the Bible’s truth that Jehovah alone is God.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Get out from among them, and separate yourselves... and quit touching the unclean thing.” <cite>—2 Corinthians 6:17</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Faithful Examples</h2>
                <p>Going to "church" isn’t enough if it clings to falsehoods. Joshua and Caleb obeyed Jehovah and entered Canaan (Joshua 14:6-9), showing that true worship—free of paganism—leads to life.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” <cite>—John 17:3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>A Future of Truth</h2>
                <p>Exploring truth means abandoning false worship for Jehovah’s way. The Bible promises a paradise where “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11), but only for those who worship in truth.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.” <cite>—Isaiah 11:9</cite>

            <summary>No Fence with Satan</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>No Middle Ground</h2>
                <p>The Bible leaves no room for indecision: if you don’t stand for Jehovah’s truth, you’ll fall for Satan’s lies. Sitting on the fence isn’t neutral—it’s a victory for the “father of the lie” (John 8:44).</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of my mouth.” <cite>—Revelation 3:16</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Israel’s Compromise</h2>
                <p>The Israelites tried to straddle both sides, keeping Jehovah’s name but bowing to Baal (2 Kings 17:16-17). Their compromise led to exile (2 Kings 17:23), proving Satan claims those who don’t fully reject lies.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “They exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the Creator.” <cite>—Romans 1:25</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Modern Fences</h2>
                <p>Today, many blend faith with Satan’s world—praying to Jehovah while celebrating pagan rites like Christmas or Easter. These are footholds for Satan, pulling people from truth into his domain.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other.” <cite>—Matthew 6:24</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Standing Firm</h2>
                <p>Standing for truth means rejecting Satan’s lies outright. Jesus didn’t waver when tempted (Matthew 4:10)—he chose Jehovah’s Word. The faithful, like Daniel, stood firm against idolatry and lived (Daniel 3:17-18).</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” <cite>—John 17:3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Choose or Lose</h2>
                <p>Satan owns the fence—indecision is a choice for lies (James 1:8). Stand for truth, and Jehovah promises a future where “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11). Truth brings life; the fence brings death.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about.” <cite>—James 1:6</cite>
