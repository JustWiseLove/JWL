        <!-- Article 1: Origins of False Worship -->
        <details>
            <summary>Origins of False Worship</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Rebellion in Eden</h2>
                <p>False worship started when Satan deceived Eve, promising independence from Jehovah (Genesis 3:1-6). This lie birthed idolatry—choosing self over God. Cain’s unacceptable offering and murder of Abel followed (Genesis 4:3-8), and by Noah’s day, polytheism fueled a corrupt world Jehovah destroyed (Genesis 6:11-13). Archaeology confirms this—Sumerian tablets from 3000 BCE list gods like Inanna, demanding blood sacrifices, unlike Jehovah’s call for exclusive devotion. People today mirror this, chasing personal desires over God’s truth, a pattern rooted in Eden.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You must not have any other gods besides me.” 
                    <cite>—Exodus 20:3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Israel’s Deadly Struggles</h2>
                <p>Israel’s history shows false worship’s cost. The golden calf mixed Egyptian paganism with Jehovah’s name, killing 3,000 (Exodus 32:4-6, 28). Worship of Baal and Molech involved child sacrifice—Jeremiah 19:5 says it never entered Jehovah’s mind. Excavations at Carthage reveal mass infant burials from such rites, with bones showing malnutrition, not divine favor. Kings like Ahab and Manasseh built altars to stars and idols (2 Kings 21:3-6), leading to exile. Today, people blend faith with holidays like Christmas, unaware of their deadly origins.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “They went mixing with the nations and learned their works.” 
                    <cite>—Psalm 106:35</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Ancestor Worship’s Roots</h2>
                <p>Honoring the dead also defied Jehovah. Egyptians mummified pharaohs as gods, misreading Genesis 5:24 about Enoch (Hebrews 11:13 clarifies he died). China’s Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE) used oracle bones to consult ancestors, yet Ecclesiastes 9:5 says “the dead know nothing.” Science agrees—EEG studies show brain death ends consciousness; no spirits linger. Today, families burn incense for loved ones, a common ritual the Bible rejects, pulling people from Jehovah’s truth into Satan’s lies.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all.” 
                    <cite>—Ecclesiastes 9:5</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>The Cross as Idolatry</h2>
                <p>The cross, revered today, traces to paganism, not Scripture. Jesus died on a stake (Greek *stauros* means pole, per John 19:17), but the cross symbol predates him—Assyrians and Egyptians used it for Tammuz worship by 1500 BCE. Constantine’s vision in 312 CE made it Christian, yet Exodus 20:4 forbids images in worship. People wear crosses as jewelry, thinking it honors Jesus, but it’s a Babylonian relic Jehovah hates, proven by historical steles and the Bible’s silence on its use.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above.” 
                    <cite>—Exodus 20:4</cite>

            <summary>False Religions Today</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Pagan Traditions Persist</h2>
                <p>Today’s holidays defy Bible truth. Christmas, set on December 25, mimics Saturnalia—Roman sun god worship with trees and lights—yet shepherds watched flocks at night (Luke 2:8), not in winter. Easter’s eggs and bunnies honor Eostre, not Jesus’ resurrection; Bede’s 725 CE writings confirm its pagan shift. Halloween’s costumes and spirits echo Samhain, condemned in Deuteronomy 18:10-12. Families decorate trees and carve pumpkins, unaware these common joys link to idolatry Jehovah rejects.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Get out from among them, and separate yourselves... and quit touching the unclean thing.” 
                    <cite>—2 Corinthians 6:17</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Doctrines That Deceive</h2>
                <p>False teachings dominate. The Trinity, set at Nicaea (325 CE), copies Egypt’s Osiris-Isis-Horus, but John 17:3 names Jehovah “the only true God.” Hellfire clashes with Ezekiel 18:4—“the soul that sins will die”—and science shows brain death ends awareness. Immortal souls, from Plato, not Genesis 2:7 (“man became a living soul”), fuel séances Leviticus 19:31 bans. People pray for eternal fire or chat with psychics, practices the Bible calls lies, not truth.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “In vain they worship me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.” 
                    <cite>—Matthew 15:9</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Saint Veneration and Nationalism</h2>
                <p>Saint worship and patriotism stray further. Catholics pray to Mary, rooted in Rome’s deified emperors, not 1 Timothy 2:5’s “one mediator, Christ Jesus.” Nationalism—pledging to flags—echoes Rome’s eagle cult, yet Psalm 146:3 warns against trusting men. By 400 CE, saint statues filled churches, per Eusebius’ records. People salute flags or light candles for saints, common acts Jehovah sees as idolatry, stealing worship from Him.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus.” 
                    <cite>—1 Timothy 2:5</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Birthdays and Beyond</h2>
                <p>Birthdays, widely celebrated, stem from paganism. Genesis 40:20 and Job 1:4 link them to Pharaoh and Job’s sons, who died for sin—early Christians like Origen (250 CE) called them heathen. Candles and wishes trace to Greek Artemis worship, not Jehovah’s approval. The cross pendant, Trinity prayers, and hellfire sermons fill churches today, yet Acts 20:20 urges teaching “house to house” God’s truth. These everyday habits—cake, crosses, creeds—blind millions to Jehovah’s standards.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were for your good.” 
                    <cite>—Acts 20:20</cite>

        <!-- Article 3: Searching for the Truth -->
        <details>
            <summary>Searching for the Truth</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Comparing Religions Honestly</h2>
                <p>Searchers must test religions against Scripture. Buddhism’s nirvana lacks Jehovah (Revelation 4:11); Hinduism’s pantheon defies Exodus 20:3. Judaism rejects Jesus (John 14:6); Islam denies his ransom (John 17:3). Catholicism’s Trinity and Easter clash with Bible simplicity—Jehovah’s Witnesses stick to it. The Bible’s science shines: Leviticus 12:3 sets circumcision on day eight, when Vitamin K peaks for clotting, unknown till 1935. People follow gurus or priests, but only Jehovah’s Word holds truth.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “If you search for it as for silver, and you seek it as for hidden treasures, then you will understand the fear of Jehovah.” 
                    <cite>—Proverbs 2:4-5</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>The Effort That Frees</h2>
                <p>Truth requires digging—Jesus promised freedom through it (John 8:32). Satan rules now (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah’s Kingdom ends suffering (Isaiah 11:9). Ecclesiastes 11:7-8 describes the water cycle—evaporation and rain—millennia before meteorology. The Dead Sea Scrolls (1947) match today’s Bible, proving its preservation. Many trust karma or mosques, but rejecting Halloween’s spirits or Trinity creeds reveals Jehovah’s way—freedom from lies.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” 
                    <cite>—John 8:32</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Beware of Subtle Lies</h2>
                <p>Subtle falsehoods trap seekers. Ancestor worship (Isaiah 8:19) and pantheism (Romans 1:25) lack evidence—biology shows no spirit in nature. Evolution claims fossils prove it, but the Cambrian Explosion’s sudden life forms defy gradual change, matching Genesis 1’s “kinds.” Buddhism’s relics and Hindu idols crumble—archaeology finds no afterlife proof. People burn incense or chase rebirth, but the Bible’s creation days align with earth’s stages—light, water, life—unlike baseless myths.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “They exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the Creator.” 
                    <cite>—Romans 1:25</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Bible Evidence Shines</h2>
                <p>The Bible’s facts outshine rivals. Genesis 1:6-8’s “expanse” fits atmospheric layers; Job 26:7 says earth hangs “upon nothing,” predating gravity’s discovery. Fossil gaps—like no fish-to-amphibian links—challenge evolution, supporting Jehovah’s design. Major religions offer no such precision—Quranic cosmology lacks detail, Hindu Vedas contradict science. People cling to crosses or reincarnation, but the Scrolls’ Isaiah 53 matches Jesus’ death, proving Jehovah’s Word is truth worth seeking.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.” 
                    <cite>—Job 26:7</cite>

            <summary>Real Truth Can Be Found</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>The Bible’s Unshakable Truth</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s Word is truth—Jesus prayed it (John 17:17). Babylon’s fall (Isaiah 13:19-20) happened by 539 BCE, its ruins unrebuilt, as digs confirm. Leviticus 13’s quarantine predates germ theory by 3,000 years. Jesus, “the truth” (John 14:6), rejected crosses and Trinity—his stake (Galatians 3:13) wasn’t a symbol. People trust hellfire sermons or birthday wishes, but true worshippers unite on Scripture, not traditions.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.” 
                    <cite>—John 17:17</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Living the Truth Now</h2>
                <p>Truth transforms—John 3:21 says it brings light. Psalm 119:105 guides us past Satan’s lies like immortal souls or Christmas trees. Daniel lived it, surviving lions (Daniel 6:22); science links honesty to health—lower cortisol levels. People wear crosses or fear hell, but living Jehovah’s way—free of pagan birthdays—brings joy now and hope for paradise, not empty rituals.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.” 
                    <cite>—Psalm 119:105</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Rejecting False Hopes</h2>
                <p>Truth exposes delusions—reincarnation and purgatory fail. Genesis 3:19 (“to dust you return”) and Hebrews 9:27 (“die once”) refute Hindu cycles; purgatory, from 1439’s Council of Florence, lacks Scripture. Decomposition proves death’s end—no afterlife energy per physics. People chase Easter bunnies or Trinity prayers, but Jehovah’s truth—backed by Dead Sea Scrolls’ accuracy—offers real life, not man-made myths.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Just as it is reserved for men to die once for all time, and after this a judgment.” 
                    <cite>—Hebrews 9:27</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Evidence Against Rivals</h2>
                <p>Bible truth trumps religions. Islam’s flat-earth hints (Quran 18:86) falter; Hinduism’s cosmic egg lacks fossil backing—Cambrian life jumps fit Genesis “kinds.” Vitamin K’s clotting peak on day eight (Leviticus 12:3) shows divine wisdom, not Buddhist chants. People fear hellfire or salute flags, but Job 36:27’s water cycle and Scrolls’ preservation prove Jehovah’s Word—man’s ideas crumble beside it.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “He draws up the drops of water; they filter as rain for his mist.” 
                    <cite>—Job 36:27</cite>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Lies That Fade</h2>
                <p>Satan rules with lies (1 John 5:19)—Christmas debt, Halloween spirits (Deuteronomy 18:10-12) bring fleeting joy. Birthdays, from Pharaoh’s feast (Genesis 40:20), tie to pagan wishes, not Jehovah. Materialism breeds stress—studies show it—since Eve’s fall (John 8:44). This world fades (1 John 2:17); people carving pumpkins or fearing hell ignore its end, chasing illusions over truth.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” 
                    <cite>—1 John 5:19</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Choosing Truth Over Illusion</h2>
                <p>Jesus chose truth (Matthew 4:10)—hellfire’s a lie (Ecclesiastes 9:5); brain death proves it. Rome and Babylon fell (Revelation 11:15 looms); Easter eggs honor Eostre, not Christ. True joy is Jehovah’s paradise (Psalm 37:11), not Trinity creeds or cross necklaces—Assyrian relics, not Jesus’ stake. People waver, but indecision aids Satan, not Jehovah.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The world is passing away and so is its desire, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.” 
                    <cite>—1 John 2:17</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Patriotic Deceptions</h2>
                <p>Nationalism deceives—flags mimic idols (Daniel 2:44). Rome’s eagle, Nazi rallies killed millions—Psalm 33:12 says Jehovah’s nation alone endures. Oxytocin fuels loyalty, science says, but it’s misdirected. People pledge allegiance or wear crosses, common yet unbiblical—Jehovah’s Kingdom, not man’s, lasts, proven by history’s fallen empires.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people he has chosen as his own possession.” 
                    <cite>—Psalm 33:12</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Man’s Failed Rule</h2>
                <p>Man’s self-rule fails—wars, pollution prove it. Genesis 3:5’s “be like God” led here; fossils show no evolution, just sudden life (Genesis 1). Rome’s Pax crumbled; today’s leaders falter—Jehovah’s purpose for paradise never changed (Isaiah 55:11). People trust governments or hellfire tales, but Job 38:22’s weather control shows Jehovah rules—man needs Him.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “My word that goes out of my mouth... will not return to me without results.”

                <h2>A World of Peace and Joy</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom brings paradise—peace, joy (Psalm 37:11). Daniel 2:44’s government ends man’s rule; Isaiah 11:9 fills earth with Jehovah’s knowledge. Unlike Satan’s holidays—Christmas trees, Easter eggs—Jehovah offers harmony. Joshua chose it (Joshua 14:6-9); faith boosts well-being, studies say.

                </div>
                <h2>Choose Everlasting Life</h2>
                <p>Jesus offers life—“knowing Jehovah” (John 17:3). History—exodus, resurrection—and science—universe’s tuning—prove it. Proverbs 23:23 says buy truth, not lies like immortal souls or crosses (Tammuz symbols). Paradise awaits, free of birthdays or hellfire fears—Isaiah 11:9’s knowledge brings joy. People pick illusions; Jehovah’s truth endures.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” 
                    <cite>—John 17:3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Abundant Blessings Await</h2>
                <p>Paradise restores Eden—lush earth, no death (Revelation 21:4). Fossils of giant ferns hint at it; Genesis 1’s days match science—light, water, life stages. No Trinity prayers or Halloween spirits—just unity, health, joy. Noah obeyed and lived (Genesis 7:23); faith now previews paradise’s abundance, unlike man’s failing rule.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.” 
                    <cite>—Revelation 21:4</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Jehovah’s Unchanging Purpose</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s plan—Paradise Earth—never wavered (Genesis 1:28). Man’s rule flops—fossil gaps, not evolution, back sudden creation; Job 38:4-6’s earth-founding fits geology. People fear hell or chase Easter, but Dead Sea Scrolls confirm Isaiah 65:17-19: new heavens, earth, joy. Man’s failure screams we need Jehovah—His Kingdom heals all.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “I am creating new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be called to mind.” 
                    <cite>—Isaiah 65:17</cite>
