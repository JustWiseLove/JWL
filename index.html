        <details>
            <summary>False Worship Begins</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Satan’s Deception in Eden</h2>
                <p>False worship ignited when Satan, as a serpent, deceived Eve into thinking she could be like God and judge right from wrong independently (Genesis 3:1-6), introducing idolatry by placing self or other gods above Jehovah, who demands sole devotion (Exodus 20:3). This rebellion spread to Cain, whose rejected sacrifice and murder of Abel defied Jehovah’s standards (Genesis 4:3-8). Sumerian tablets from 3000 BCE, listing gods like Enki with blood offerings, show polytheism’s rapid rise after Eden.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You must not have any other gods besides me.” 
                    <cite>—Exodus 20:3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>The Golden Calf Incident</h2>
                <p>Fresh from Egypt’s deliverance, the Israelites forged a golden calf, blending Jehovah’s worship with Egyptian bull god Apis practices, incurring about 3,000 deaths as punishment (Exodus 32:4-6, 28), a mix Deuteronomy 12:31 calls detestable. Hazor’s calf figurines from 1400 BCE confirm this idolatry’s spread. It warns against tainting Jehovah’s worship with human traditions.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Every detestable thing that Jehovah hates, they have done.” 
                    <cite>—Deuteronomy 12:31</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Baal Worship and Sacrifices</h2>
                <p>Baal worship lured Israel into child sacrifice, an act Jehovah never imagined (Jeremiah 19:5), led by kings like Ahab with altars and poles (1 Kings 16:31-32), bringing ruin and judgment. Carthage urns from 800 BCE, holding diseased infant bones, show no blessing, only horror. This reveals Satan’s grip pulling people from Jehovah’s life-giving way.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “They built the high places of Baal... to make their sons and daughters pass through the fire.” 
                    <cite>—Jeremiah 19:5</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Ancestor Worship’s Rise</h2>
                <p>Ancestor worship defied Jehovah’s truth about death, with Egyptians mummifying pharaohs as gods by 2600 BCE, misreading Enoch (Genesis 5:24; Hebrews 11:13 says he died), and China’s Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE) consulting the dead via oracle bones, despite Ecclesiastes 9:5’s “the dead know nothing.” EEGs confirm consciousness ends at death, exposing this early falsehood.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all.” 
                    <cite>—Ecclesiastes 9:5</cite>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Christmas and Paganism</h2>
                <p>Christmas, pegged to December 25, stems from Saturnalia, a Roman sun god festival with feasts, gifts, and evergreens (Pliny, 77 CE), not Jesus’ birth—Luke 2:8’s shepherds suggest a warmer season—shunned by early Christians like Tertullian (200 CE) as pagan. Jehovah demands separation (2 Corinthians 6:17), yet trees and presents persist, echoing idolatry.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Get out from among them, and separate yourselves... and quit touching the unclean thing.” 
                    <cite>—2 Corinthians 6:17</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Easter’s Fertility Rites</h2>
                <p>Easter mixes Jesus’ resurrection with Eostre’s fertility rites—eggs and rabbits from Saxon spring festivals (Bede, 725 CE)—unsupported by Scripture’s weekly meetings (Acts 20:7) or symbols, with Germanic rabbit icons from 500 CE predating Christianity. Jehovah rejects man-made worship (Matthew 15:9), yet egg hunts continue.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “In vain they worship me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.” 
                    <cite>—Matthew 15:9</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Halloween and Spiritism</h2>
                <p>Halloween derives from Samhain, a Celtic dead-honoring festival banned as spiritism (Deuteronomy 18:10-12), with costumes and turnips from 900 CE Ireland, later tied to All Saints’ Day (835 CE). Leviticus 19:31 forbids spirit contact, yet trick-or-treating upholds this pagan rite.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “There should not be found in you anyone who... consults the dead.” 
                    <cite>—Deuteronomy 18:10-11</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Birthdays’ Pagan Roots</h2>
                <p>Birthdays in Scripture—Pharaoh’s (Genesis 40:20-22) with an execution, Herod’s (Mark 6:21-28) with John’s beheading—link to pagan death, not joy, with Greek Artemis candles (Herodotus, 450 BCE) rejected by Christians like Origen (250 CE). Ecclesiastes 7:1 favors death’s day, yet parties mimic false gods.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The day of death is better than the day of birth.” 
                    <cite>—Ecclesiastes 7:1</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Temple Commerce Today</h2>
                <p>Jesus expelled temple merchants twice—early with a whip (John 2:13-16) and later flipping tables (Matthew 21:12-13)—calling it a “cave of robbers” (Jeremiah 7:11), not prayer, as Roman records (30 CE) note market activity. Modern church yard sales repeat this misuse.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a cave of robbers.” 
                    <cite>—Matthew 21:13</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Fate and Astrology</h2>
                <p>Fate via astrology claims a fixed destiny, unlike Jehovah’s free will offer—“choose life” (Deuteronomy 30:19), “choose whom you serve” (Joshua 24:15)—with Babylonians (2000 BCE) mapping stars, debunked by science showing no celestial sway. Horoscopes mislead, denying choice.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “I have put life and death before you... choose life.” 
                    <cite>—Deuteronomy 30:19</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>The Cross Symbol</h2>
                <p>The cross, a pagan symbol for Tammuz (1500 BCE), not Jesus’ stake (*stauros*, Galatians 3:13), violates Exodus 20:4’s image ban, adopted by Constantine (312 CE) per Eusebius. Early Christians shunned it; today’s jewelry honors falsehood, not Jehovah.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You must not make for yourself a carved image.” 
                    <cite>—Exodus 20:4</cite>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Judaism’s Rejection of Jesus</h2>
                <p>Judaism honors Jehovah but denies Jesus as Messiah, missing Isaiah 53’s suffering servant from the Dead Sea Scrolls (150 BCE), fulfilled in Christ (John 14:6), adding Talmud traditions like Hanukkah (200-500 CE) not in Scripture. Masada’s synagogues (70 CE) show Law devotion, not Jehovah’s full plan.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” 
                    <cite>—John 14:6</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Buddhism’s Godless Quest</h2>
                <p>Buddhism seeks nirvana, ignoring Jehovah as Creator (Revelation 4:11), with Siddhartha’s 500 BCE teachings unproven—relics like Buddha’s tooth lack evidence, and science (EEGs) refutes reincarnation. It’s a godless path, missing Jehovah’s truth.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things.” 
                    <cite>—Revelation 4:11</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Hinduism’s Polytheistic Maze</h2>
                <p>Hinduism’s many gods—Vishnu, Shiva—clash with Exodus 20:3, its Vedas (1200 BCE) pushing reincarnation against Genesis 3:19’s dust return and Cambrian sudden life (540 million years ago). Angkor Wat (1100 CE) lacks rebirth proof, veiling Jehovah’s light.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You must not have any other gods besides me.” 
                    <cite>—Exodus 20:3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Islam’s Denial of the Ransom</h2>
                <p>Islam’s Allah omits Jesus’ ransom (John 17:3), denying his death (Quran 4:157), with Muhammad’s 610 CE revelations tied to the pagan Kaaba (Ibn Hisham, 800 CE) and a flat-earth hint (Quran 71:19) lagging Job 26:7. It misses Jehovah’s plan.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” 
                    <cite>—John 17:3</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Catholicism’s Human Traditions</h2>
                <p>Catholicism’s saint prayers and Trinity lack Scrolls (1947) support, defying 1 Timothy 2:5’s one mediator, Jesus, with Constantine’s cross (312 CE) and Trent (1545) adding paganism, unlike early Christians (Justin Martyr, 150 CE). It clouds Jehovah’s worship.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus.” 
                    <cite>—1 Timothy 2:5</cite>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Biblical Scientific Accuracy</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s Word predates science—Leviticus 12:3’s eighth-day circumcision aligns with Vitamin K peaks (1935 discovery), Job 26:7’s earth “upon nothing” precedes gravity, and Ecclesiastes 1:7’s water cycle beats meteorology, proving its divine shine.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “He stretches out the northern sky over empty space, suspending the earth upon nothing.” 
                    <cite>—Job 26:7</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Creation’s Orderly Design</h2>
                <p>Genesis 1’s days—light, atmosphere, land, sun, sea life, animals—match earth’s stages, with Cambrian Explosion (540 million years ago) showing sudden “kinds,” no evolution fossils (e.g., fish-to-amphibian), refuting Darwin and shining as Jehovah’s truth.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” 
                    <cite>—Genesis 1:1</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Dead Sea Scrolls’ Testimony</h2>
                <p>Dead Sea Scrolls (1947) affirm Scripture—Isaiah (150 BCE) matches today, 900 manuscripts (250 BCE-70 CE) confirm Daniel 9:24-26’s Jesus prediction, shining eternally (1 Peter 1:25) unlike shifting human works.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The word of Jehovah remains forever.” 
                    <cite>—1 Peter 1:25</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Jehovah’s Name Revealed</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s name, used 7,000+ times (Exodus 3:15, Psalm 83:18), was obscured by “LORD” since 3rd-century CE edits (Codex Sinaiticus), but Jesus declared it (John 17:6), a shining truth distinguishing Jehovah’s worship.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “That men may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” 
                    <cite>—Psalm 83:18</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Living the Truth</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s truth lights life—John 3:21 shows acting on it saves, like Daniel’s lion escape (Daniel 6:22), with Psalm 119:105 guiding via science-backed peace (less stress), offering joy now and forever.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.”

                <h2>Satan’s Temporary Dominion</h2>
                <p>Satan rules now (1 John 5:19), deceiving since Eden (John 8:44), with empires like Babylon and Rome falling (Revelation 11:15) and man’s wars since Sumer (3000 BCE) failing, soon ended by Jehovah’s Kingdom (Daniel 2:44).</p>

                <h2>The Trinity Doctrine</h2>
                <p>Trinity, from Nicaea (325 CE), mimics pagan triads (e.g., Ninurta-Nergal), not Scripture—John 17:3 names Jehovah alone true God, 1 Corinthians 11:3 ranks Him above Christ, rejected by early Christians (Justin Martyr, 150 CE).</p>

                <h2>Hellfire’s False Fear</h2>
                <p>Hellfire contradicts Ezekiel 18:4—“the soul who sins will die”—from Greek Hades and Dante (1320), not Bible, with EEGs showing death ends awareness, exposing Satan’s scare tactic against Jehovah’s justice.</p>

                <h2>The Immortal Soul Myth</h2>
                <p>Immortal soul, from Plato (400 BCE), not Genesis 2:7’s “living soul,” denies Ecclesiastes 9:10’s “no work in the Grave” and Leviticus 19:31’s spiritism ban, with Egyptian tombs (2500 BCE) and decay studies exposing Satan’s lie.</p>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Jehovah’s Original Purpose</h2>
                <p>Jehovah planned Paradise Earth (Genesis 1:28), undone by Satan’s lie, not His will—man’s self-rule fails, with wars since Sumer (3000 BCE), but Psalm 37:11 and Jesus’ ransom (John 17:3) restore it.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.” 
                    <cite>—Psalm 37:11</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Paradise Restored</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom ends death (Revelation 21:4), reviving Eden—fossils (300 million years old) hint at its past—where homes and vineyards thrive (Isaiah 65:21-22) and animals live peacefully (Isaiah 11:6-9), surpassing man’s chaos.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “They will build houses and live in them, and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.” 
                    <cite>—Isaiah 65:21</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Everlasting Life Ahead</h2>
                <p>Paradise brings eternal life—Psalm 133:3’s dew-like renewal, health from Leviticus’ laws (science-approved), death gone (1 Corinthians 15:26), and resurrection (John 5:28-29) under Jehovah’s knowledge (Isaiah 11:9), outshining man’s ruin.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The last enemy, death, is to be brought to nothing.” 
                    <cite>—1 Corinthians 15:26</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Choosing Jehovah’s Way</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom crushes man’s rule (Daniel 2:44), spreading His knowledge (Isaiah 11:9)—faith’s peace shines now (studies confirm)—urging choice of truth (Proverbs 23:23) via Jesus (John 14:6) over Satan’s failure.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Buy truth and do not sell it—wisdom and discipline and understanding.” 
                    <cite>—Proverbs 23:23</cite>
                </div>
            </div>
        </details>

        <!-- Article 7: Follow Jesus’ Way -->
        <details>
            <summary>Follow Jesus’ Way</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Using Jehovah’s Name</h2>
                <p>Jesus imitated Jehovah by making His name known, praying “I have made your name manifest” (John 17:6) and teaching its use (Matthew 6:9), echoing its 7,000+ Bible mentions (Psalm 83:18), unlike 3rd-century CE removals (Codex Sinaiticus). We follow by boldly saying “Jehovah” in worship.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me.” 
                    <cite>—John 17:6</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Bible Over Traditions</h2>
                <p>Jesus prioritized Scripture over traditions, rebuking Pharisees for nullifying God’s Word with rules (Mark 7:13), teaching from the Law and Prophets (Luke 4:16-17), not man-made creeds. We imitate him by studying the Bible daily, rejecting holiday rituals.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You make the word of God invalid by your tradition.” 
                    <cite>—Mark 7:13</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Sharing Truth House-to-House</h2>
                <p>Jesus shared truth personally, teaching in homes and villages (Luke 8:1), a model his disciples followed house-to-house (Acts 20:20), unlike distant clergy of his day. We follow by knocking on doors, offering Jehovah’s hope directly.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were for your good.” 
                    <cite>—Acts 20:20</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>No War or Politics</h2>
                <p>Jesus avoided war and politics, saying “my Kingdom is no part of this world” (John 18:36) and refusing Satan’s rule (Matthew 4:8-10), unlike zealots of 30 CE. We imitate by staying neutral, loving enemies (Matthew 5:44), not fighting or voting.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “My Kingdom is no part of this world.” 
                    <cite>—John 18:36</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Praying to Jehovah</h2>
                <p>Jesus prayed directly to Jehovah, teaching “Our Father in the heavens” (Matthew 6:9) and crying out in need (Matthew 27:46), not to saints or idols, a practice from 30 CE Jerusalem. We follow by praying only to Jehovah, trusting Him alone.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.” 
                    <cite>—Matthew 6:9</cite>
                </div>
            </div>
        </details>

        <!-- Article 8: One True Faith -->
        <details>
            <summary>One True Faith</summary>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>The Narrow Path</h2>
                <p>Jesus taught a narrow path to life, saying “few are finding it” (Matthew 7:13-14), unlike broad, popular religions blending paganism and lies—Jehovah’s Witnesses alone walk this tight road, rejecting worldly ways for Bible truth since 1870s studies by Charles Taze Russell.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are finding it.” 
                    <cite>—Matthew 7:14</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Not All Enter</h2>
                <p>Jesus warned that not all saying “Lord, Lord” enter the Kingdom, only those doing Jehovah’s will (Matthew 7:21-23)—Jehovah’s Witnesses stand apart, obeying God’s laws over man’s, unlike churches claiming faith yet steeped in 4th-century CE pagan creeds.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father.” 
                    <cite>—Matthew 7:21</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Bible Alone</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses use only the Bible, as 2 Timothy 3:16 declares it sufficient, rejecting added books like the Talmud, Quran, or catechisms—since 1931, their New World Translation restores Jehovah’s name, unlike religions diluting truth with human texts.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight.” 
                    <cite>—2 Timothy 3:16</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Pure Worship</h2>
                <p>Jesus demanded worship “with spirit and truth” (John 4:23-24), free of paganism—Jehovah’s Witnesses shun Christmas, Easter, and crosses, unlike 2nd-century CE church compromises, keeping Jehovah’s service clean as Russell’s Bible Students began.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “The true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth.” 
                    <cite>—John 4:23</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Making Disciples</h2>
                <p>Jesus commanded “go, make disciples” (Matthew 28:19-20), teaching all nations Jehovah’s truth—Jehovah’s Witnesses obey, training millions globally since 1919, unlike static churches of Christendom, fulfilling this charge with Bible-based education.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them... teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded.” 
                    <cite>—Matthew 28:19-20</cite>
                </div>
                <h2>Witnesses of Truth</h2>
                <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses prove the truth—neutral in war (Isaiah 2:4), preaching globally, unified without clergy (1 Corinthians 1:10), unlike divided, politicized faiths since Rome’s fall (476 CE). Named His witnesses (Isaiah 43:10), their fruits since 1919 show Jehovah’s blessing.</p>
                <div class="scripture">
                    “You are my witnesses,” declares Jehovah, “and I am God.” 
                    <cite>—Isaiah 43:10</cite>
