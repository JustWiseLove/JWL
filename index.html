                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>Satan rules this world with a system of temporary highs—wealth, power, and pleasures that fade fast (John 12:31). From Eve’s first bite, he’s peddled quick fixes that dazzle but deliver dust, a fleeting rush that traps souls in despair.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” —1 John 5:19</p>

                        <p>Jehovah counters with everlasting rewards—wisdom, peace, and life that never ends. His Kingdom isn’t a momentary thrill but a permanent promise, built on truth that outlasts Satan’s crumbling empire.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Most Holy One is understanding.” —Proverbs 9:10</p>

                        <p>Satan’s world tempts with instant gratification—riches today, gone tomorrow (1 John 2:16). Jehovah’s way demands faith but offers eternity, a paradise where the faithful stand forever (Psalm 37:29). The contrast is stark: fleeting lies or enduring truth.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The world is passing away and so is its desire, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.” —1 John 2:17</p>

                        <p>Jesus faced Satan’s bribes and chose Jehovah’s path (Matthew 4:10), proving temporary satisfaction can’t rival everlasting life. History shows Satan’s glitter fades—wars, greed, ruin—while Jehovah’s promise holds firm.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</p>

                        <p>Choose Satan’s fleeting world, and you chase shadows that vanish. Choose Jehovah, and you gain a future unshaken. Stand for truth or fall for lies—the stakes are eternal.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.” —Psalm 37:11</p>

                <details>
                    <summary class="card-header">Truth or False Worship</summary>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>Worshiping Jehovah demands truth—half-measures invite disaster. The Bible shows false worship as a deadly trap, luring the careless away from life.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must not have any other gods besides me.” —Exodus 20:3</p>

                        <p>The Israelites mixed Jehovah’s name with pagan idols, like the golden calf (Exodus 32:4-6). God struck down thousands (Exodus 32:28). They burned children to Baal (Jeremiah 19:5), and many died in the wilderness, missing the Promised Land (Numbers 14:29-30).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They went mixing with the nations and learned their works.” —Psalm 106:35</p>

                        <p>Today’s false worship hides in plain sight—Christmas from Saturnalia’s sun worship, Easter’s fertility rites to Eostre, the Trinity echoing Babylon’s triads, and birthdays rooted in spiritism. These aren’t innocent; they’re lies cloaked as faith.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Get out from among them, and separate yourselves... and quit touching the unclean thing.” —2 Corinthians 6:17</p>

                        <p>Church pews don’t save if pagan traditions rule. Joshua and Caleb chose pure worship and lived (Joshua 14:6-9), while compromisers fell. False worship risks paradise for empty rituals.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</p>

                        <p>Jehovah seeks worship “in spirit and truth” (John 4:23-24), not pagan blends. Stand for truth or fall for lies—only one path leads to a world of pure peace (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.” —Isaiah 11:9</p>

        <div class="featured-section">

                <details>
                    <summary class="card-header">Satan Owns The Fence</summary>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>Life offers no middle ground—wavering between Jehovah and Satan hands victory to the “father of the lie” (John 8:44). Indecision isn’t safe; it’s Satan’s playground.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of my mouth.” —Revelation 3:16</p>

                        <p>The Israelites hedged bets, serving Jehovah and Baal (2 Kings 17:16-17). Their fence-sitting led to exile (2 Kings 17:23), a stark warning that straddling truth and lies ends in loss.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the Creator.” —Romans 1:25</p>

                        <p>Modern fence-sitters pray to Jehovah yet indulge in Satan’s traps—pagan holidays, false doctrines, worldly lures. Each step off truth’s path strengthens Satan’s grip.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other.” —Matthew 6:24</p>

                        <p>Jesus picked truth, rejecting Satan’s offers (Matthew 4:10). Daniel stood firm against idols and survived (Daniel 3:17-18). Their choice for Jehovah’s way paved the road to life.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.” —John 17:3</p>

                        <p>Satan owns the fence—doubt feeds his lies (James 1:8). Jehovah’s truth offers paradise (Psalm 37:11), but only for the decided. Stand for truth or fall—eternity hangs on it.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about.” —James 1:6</p>
