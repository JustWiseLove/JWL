                        <h2>Cosmos and Earth Testify to Jehovah’s Wisdom</h2>
                        <p>The universe’s majestic order, from galaxies to oceans, proclaims Jehovah’s purposeful design, as “The heavens are declaring the glory of God; and the expanse is proclaiming the work of his hands.” Creation’s harmony and complexity demand a divine architect. — Psalm 19:1</p>
                        <p><strong>Galaxies: Cosmic Masterpieces:</strong> Over 2 trillion galaxies, each with 100 billion stars, orbit with precision, as “He is counting the number of the stars; all of them he calls by their names.” The Milky Way spans 100,000 light-years, its 200 billion stars in perfect balance. David was awed, saying, “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind?” — Psalm 147:4, Psalm 8:3-4</p>
                        <p><strong>Ecosystems: Interwoven Harmony:</strong> Earth’s ecosystems, like coral reefs with 1 million species, thrive in balance, as “How many your works are, O Jehovah! You have made all of them in wisdom. The earth is full of your productions.” Rainforests, 6% of land, produce 20% oxygen for 7.8 billion people. This interdependence, recycling 10 billion tons of carbon yearly, demands design. — Psalm 104:24</p>
                        <p><strong>Weather Systems: Cycles of Renewal:</strong> Weather cycles 37.5 trillion tons of water across 510 million square kilometers, as “All the streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is not full.” Hurricanes release 600 trillion watts, nurturing ecosystems. This precision, as “He has made everything beautiful in its time,” proves divine order. — Ecclesiastes 1:7, Ecclesiastes 3:11</p>
                        <p><strong>Geologic Formations: Enduring Testimony:</strong> Mountains like Everest (29,032 feet) and canyons like the Grand Canyon (277 miles) showcase power, as “He has established the mountains by his strength.” Plate tectonics recycle 43,000 square miles of crust, stabilizing earth. These endure as proof. — Psalm 65:6</p>
                        <p><strong>Oceans: Vast Reservoirs of Life:</strong> Oceans, covering 71% of earth, hold 1.332 billion km³ of water, as “He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap.” Currents like the Gulf Stream move 100 million cubic meters/second, regulating climate. Hosting 230,000 species, oceans produce 50% of oxygen, proving design. — Psalm 33:7</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Stargaze for galaxies, hike forests for ecosystems, track storms, visit canyons, or dive oceans. Journal observations, meditate on Jehovah’s wisdom, and share insights, as “Sing to Jehovah a new song, for he has done wonderful things!” — Psalm 98:1</p>
                        <p class="scripture">The heavens are declaring the glory of God; and the expanse is proclaiming the work of his hands. — Psalm 19:1</p>
