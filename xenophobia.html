                        <h2>(c. Creation, Genesis 1)</h2>
                        <p>From the beginning, Jehovah created all humanity from one man, Adam, showing His approval of all races and ethnicities as one family. Genesis 1:26, 27 states, “Let us make man in our image,” and “male and female he created them,” with no distinction of race or culture. Acts 17:26 reinforces this: “He made out of one man every nation of men to dwell on the entire surface of the earth.” This unity in creation, dated to the beginning of human history in biblical chronology, establishes Jehovah’s impartiality toward all peoples.</p>
                        <p>The diversity of languages and cultures arose later at Babel (Genesis 11:9), but Jehovah’s purpose remained for all to seek Him (Acts 17:27). Unlike ancient myths that divided humanity by divine favoritism, such as the Babylonian Enuma Elish favoring certain tribes, Jehovah’s Word affirms equal value for all, fulfilling “God saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good” (Genesis 1:31).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“God saw everything he had made, and look! it was very good.” — Genesis 1:31</p>

                        <h2>(c. 1943 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s covenant with Abraham, dated around 1943 BCE through biblical chronology, extended His approval to all nations. Genesis 12:3 declares, “By means of you all the families of the earth will be blessed.” This promise, reiterated to Isaac and Jacob (Genesis 26:4; 28:14), shows Jehovah’s purpose to include every race and ethnicity in His blessings, transcending cultural boundaries.</p>
                        <p>Abraham’s interactions with foreigners, like the Hittites (Genesis 23:3-4), were marked by respect, reflecting Jehovah’s impartiality. This contrasts with ancient practices, such as Egypt’s exclusion of foreigners in sacred rites (as seen in the Papyrus of Ani, circa 1250 BCE). Jehovah’s promise, fulfilled through Jesus (Galatians 3:16), underscores His love for all, fulfilling “I will bless those who bless you” (Genesis 12:3).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I will bless those who bless you.” — Genesis 12:3</p>

                        <h2>(c. 1513 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Law given to Israel through Moses around 1513 BCE included provisions for foreigners, showing His approval of all ethnicities. Leviticus 19:34 commands, “The foreigner residing among you should become to you like a native among you; and you must love him as yourself.” Numbers 15:15 adds, “The same regulation will apply to you and to the foreign resident.” These laws ensured equal justice and worship opportunities for non-Israelites, such as the Egyptians who joined the Exodus (Exodus 12:38).</p>
                        <p>Historical records, like the Amarna Letters (circa 1350 BCE), show other nations often oppressed foreigners, but Jehovah’s Law promoted inclusion, as seen in Rahab the Canaanite’s acceptance (Joshua 6:25). This divine standard reflects Jehovah’s impartiality, fulfilling “You must love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“You must love your neighbor as yourself.” — Leviticus 19:18</p>

                        <h2>(c. 8th–5th Century BCE)</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s prophets, writing between the 8th and 5th centuries BCE, foretold a time when all nations would worship Him, showing His approval of every race and culture. Isaiah 2:2, 3 (circa 740 BCE) prophesies, “In the final part of the days, the mountain of the house of Jehovah will become firmly established, and all the nations will stream to it.” Zechariah 8:23 (circa 520 BCE) adds, “Ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying: ‘We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’”</p>
                        <p>These prophecies contrast with other ancient texts, like the Assyrian Annals (circa 700 BCE), which boast of racial supremacy. Jehovah’s vision, preserved in the Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-14 dated 200 BCE–70 CE), included foreigners like the Ethiopian eunuch (Isaiah 56:3-5), fulfilling “My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples” (Isaiah 56:7).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples.” — Isaiah 56:7</p>

                        <h2>(c. 29–33 CE)</h2>
                        <p>Jesus’ ministry from 29 to 33 CE, as recorded in the Gospels, demonstrated Jehovah’s approval of all nationalities by breaking cultural barriers. John 4:9-10 recounts Jesus speaking with a Samaritan woman, a group despised by Jews, offering her “living water.” Matthew 15:21-28 shows Him healing the daughter of a Canaanite woman, praising her faith despite her ethnicity. Jesus’ parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:29-37) further taught love across racial divides.</p>
                        <p>Unlike the Roman society of the time, which segregated based on ethnicity (e.g., Roman citizenship laws excluding many), Jesus’ actions fulfilled Jehovah’s impartiality, as seen in His command: “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19). Early manuscripts like Codex Sinaiticus (paleography dated 325–350 CE) preserve these accounts, affirming “God so loved the world” (John 3:16).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“God so loved the world.” — John 3:16</p>

                        <p>The early Christian congregation, from 33 to 100 CE, exemplified Jehovah’s approval of all peoples as the good news spread to diverse nations. Acts 2:5-11 describes the Pentecost miracle, where Jews and proselytes from Parthia, Media, Egypt, and Rome heard the message in their own languages. Acts 10:34-35 recounts Peter’s realization after meeting Cornelius, a Roman centurion: “God is not partial, but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.”</p>
                        <p>Paul’s missionary journeys reached Greeks, Romans, and Asians (Acts 19:10), uniting them in worship, as seen in Galatians 3:28: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor freeman, male nor female, for you are all one in union with Christ Jesus.” This unity, preserved in early manuscripts like Papyrus P46 (circa 200 CE), contrasts with the Roman Empire’s ethnic hierarchies, fulfilling “Look! A great crowd out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues” (Revelation 7:9).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Look! A great crowd out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.” — Revelation 7:9</p>

                        <p>In modern times, Jehovah’s Witnesses, since their organized efforts grew in 1919, have fulfilled Jehovah’s impartiality by uniting people worldwide. Revelation 7:9-10’s vision of “a great crowd out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues” is seen today, with over 8.6 million Witnesses in 240 lands (as of 2024 JW.org reports), worshiping in unity. The New World Translation, available in over 200 languages, ensures all can access Jehovah’s Word, from indigenous tribes in the Amazon to urban centers in Asia.</p>
                        <p>Unlike historical movements that promoted racial division, such as apartheid in South Africa (1948–1994), Jehovah’s Witnesses reject xenophobia, as seen in their global conventions where diverse cultures worship together. This modern fulfillment aligns with Jehovah’s purpose, fulfilling “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.” — Isaiah 11:9</p>

                        <h2>(Future Fulfillment)</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom will fully eliminate xenophobia, uniting all races and cultures in perfect harmony, as foretold in scripture. Psalm 22:27 promises, “All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to Jehovah, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him.” Revelation 21:3-4 describes a future where “God’s tent is with mankind,” and “death will be no more,” with no racial or cultural divisions, only peace for “every nation and tribe and tongue.”</p>
                        <p>Unlike human governments that perpetuate division, as seen in modern conflicts like ethnic cleansing in Rwanda (1994), Jehovah’s Kingdom will ensure equality, as “Jehovah will be King over all the earth” (Zechariah 14:9). This hope, rooted in Jehovah’s impartial love, fulfills “They will not cause any harm or any ruin in all my holy mountain” (Isaiah 11:9), uniting all humanity forever.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“They will not cause any harm or any ruin.” — Isaiah 11:9</p>
