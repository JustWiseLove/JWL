                        <p>If you’ve had it rough—drugs, violence, neglect, or hitting rock bottom—you know pain that lingers. This world pushes temporary relief, like self-medication, but it’s a fleeting shadow. The Bible offers Jehovah’s power to lift you from rock bottom, giving strength to heal and a future to hold onto.</p>
                        <p>Jesus invites, “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you” (Matthew 11:28). Unlike quick fixes, Jehovah’s help lasts. When Israel groaned under Egypt’s chains around 1513 BCE, Jehovah promised, “I will take you as my people” (Exodus 6:7). He sees you at your lowest: “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those who are crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18).</p>
                        <p>Tired of temporary patches? David, fleeing danger, trusted, “Jehovah is my rock and my stronghold” (Psalm 18:2), not worldly escapes. You’re called to a life awake, with hope for “new heavens and a new earth” where “the former things will not be called to mind” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted.” —Psalm 34:18</p>

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <p>People who’ve had it rough—facing violence, addiction, or loss—often reach for something new, driven to change their outcome. Those who skate by or have it easy rarely dig deep; comfort lulls them into staying the same. The Bible shows why hardship fuels transformation and how Jehovah guides it.</p>
                        <p>Rahab, from a pagan city around 1473 BCE, hit a turning point. She chose Jehovah, saying, “Jehovah your God is God” (Joshua 2:11), and gained a new life as Jesus’ ancestor (Matthew 1:5). Hardship pushed her to act, unlike her neighbors who stayed put and perished. The Bible promises, “Whoever walks in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <p>Those well-off naturally resist change; Israel, when prosperous, forgot Jehovah, following “the ways of the nations” (2 Kings 17:8). But you, tired of a rough path, seek better. Jehovah directs, “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you” (Ezekiel 36:26), turning your desire for change into a life that’s not just different, but his.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I will give you a new heart.” —Ezekiel 36:26</p>

                        <p>Tough times test faith, but enduring them shows the power of trusting Jehovah, unlike those who face no difficulty and drift without purpose. Job’s story proves how suffering, met with faith, strengthens devotion and brings Jehovah’s reward.</p>
                        <p>Job lost everything—family, wealth, health—yet declared, “Until I expire, I will not renounce my integrity” (Job 27:5). Around 1473 BCE, his endurance answered Satan’s taunt, “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God?” (Job 1:9). Jehovah restored him double, proving, “Jehovah gives, and Jehovah takes away” (Job 1:21; 42:10). Your trials, too, can build faith: “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13).</p>
                        <p>People who always have it easy don’t try for more; like Israel’s complacent kings, they fell when untested (Hosea 13:6). But you, forged in hardship, grow through endurance, as “tribulation produces endurance” (Romans 5:3). Jehovah sees your heart, promising, “I will make you wise” (Psalm 51:6).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Until I expire, I will not renounce my integrity.” —Job 27:5</p>

                        <p>Rough times often leave anger burning inside, a scar from violence or pain. The Bible warns against losing control and shows Jehovah’s way to heal, turning rage into peace for you and those you love.</p>
                        <p>Scripture says, “A fool gives full vent to his spirit, but a wise person keeps it in check” (Proverbs 29:11). Cain’s fury killed Abel, defying Jehovah’s warning, “Sin is crouching at the entrance” (Genesis 4:7). David, though, spared Saul: “I will not raise my hand against Jehovah’s anointed” (1 Samuel 26:11). Anger unchecked harms, as “the one who is quick-tempered acts foolishly” (Proverbs 14:17).</p>
                        <p>Jehovah guides control: “Be agitated, but do not sin. Have your say in your heart, on your bed, and keep silent” (Psalm 4:4). Jesus added, “Everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice” (Matthew 5:22). Pray like Nehemiah—“I prayed to the God of the heavens” (Nehemiah 2:4)—and find “the peace of God that surpasses all understanding” (Philippians 4:7).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“A wise person keeps it in check.” —Proverbs 29:11</p>

                        <p>If your childhood lacked love or time, you’re driven to give your children more—a home of faith and care. The Bible guides you to break the cycle, raising them with Jehovah’s truth for a different outcome.</p>
                        <p>Jehovah instructs, “These words that I am commanding you today must prove to be on your heart. You must inculcate them in your children” (Deuteronomy 6:6-7). Eunice ensured Timothy knew “from infancy you have known the holy writings” (2 Timothy 3:15), despite obstacles. Your resolve mirrors this, giving what you missed.</p>
                        <p>Don’t repeat neglect, like Eli, whose sons died for his failure—“Jehovah’s word came against Eli” (1 Samuel 3:12). Instead, guide firmly: “Train a boy in the way he should go; even when he grows old he will not depart from it” (Proverbs 22:6). Jehovah promises, “I will pour out my spirit on your descendants” (Isaiah 44:3).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Train a boy in the way he should go.” —Proverbs 22:6</p>

                        <p>Faith can divide you from family tied to your rough past. Jesus warned of this, but Jehovah helps you stand for truth, loving others without losing your way.</p>
                        <p>Jesus said, “I came to cause division, a man against his father, a daughter against her mother” (Matthew 10:35). Early Christians faced kin’s scorn yet held fast: “Through many tribulations we must enter into the Kingdom of God” (Acts 14:22). You’re free to leave old ways—“a man will leave his father and mother” (Matthew 19:5).</p>
                        <p>Love doesn’t mean compromise. Jesus cared for his mother—“See! Your mother!” (John 19:27)—but served Jehovah first. Balance with peace: “If possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men” (Romans 12:18). Like Abraham leaving Ur (Genesis 12:4), choose Jehovah’s path, no matter who turns away.</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I came to cause division.” —Matthew 10:35</p>

                        <p>When family rejects your faith, Jehovah gives you a better one—those who share his truth. This bond, unlike temporary ties, brings purpose and strength.</p>
                        <p>Jesus taught, “Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven, that one is my brother and sister and mother” (Matthew 12:50). He urged, “Make disciples of people of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19), and Paul said, “Let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith” (Galatians 6:10). Levi left his past to share truth (Luke 5:27-29).</p>
                        <p>Love kin, but don’t chase rejection: “Do not throw your pearls before swine” (Matthew 7:6). Faith might reach them—“she might save her husband” (1 Corinthians 7:16)—but your home is with Jehovah’s people, “a people for his name” (Acts 15:14).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Especially toward those related to us in the faith.” —Galatians 6:10</p>

                        <p>Jesus urged, “Seek first the Kingdom and his righteousness” (Matthew 6:33). He stood firm: “Whoever has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me” (Matthew 10:37). Despite family doubts (Mark 3:21), he chose God. You don’t bend: “If anyone is trying to please men, he is not a slave of Christ” (Galatians 1:10).</p>
                        <p>Live for Jehovah, like Ruth choosing Naomi’s God (Ruth 1:16). He promises, “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you” (James 4:8).
