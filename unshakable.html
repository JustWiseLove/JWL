                        <h2>Unshakable Government Over Earth</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom, ruled by Christ, is a real government, unshakable in its authority to transform earth, as “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed” (Daniel 2:44). Unlike human rulers, it ensures justice and peace (Isaiah 9:7).</p>
                        <p><strong>Christ’s Role:</strong> Jesus, enthroned in 1914, reigns as King (Revelation 11:15). As Ransomer, He redeemed humanity (1 Timothy 2:5-6); as High Priest, He intercedes (Hebrews 4:15-16); as Judge, He will execute justice (Acts 17:31). His rule fulfills Jehovah’s purpose, as “Jehovah has sworn, ‘As I have intended, so it will occur’” (Isaiah 14:24).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> Amid political chaos, the faithful trust Christ’s Kingdom to restore earth, fulfilling “the righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” — Revelation 11:15</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Jehovah’s Word Never Fails</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s prophecies, fulfilled with precision, prove His promises are unshakable, as “not one word of all his good promises failed” (1 Kings 8:56). From ancient Israel to modern times, fulfilled predictions confirm Jehovah’s sovereignty.</p>
                        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Jeremiah foretold Jerusalem’s 70-year desolation (Jeremiah 25:11-12), fulfilled when Babylon fell in 539 BCE and Jews returned in 537 BCE (Ezra 1:1-3). Daniel’s prophecy of successive world powers—Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome—unfolded exactly (Daniel 2:31-43). In 1914, global war marked the “last days” foretold by Jesus (Matthew 24:7; 2 Timothy 3:1-5).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> These fulfillments assure the faithful that Jehovah’s future promises, like paradise, are certain, strengthening endurance, as “my word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“As I have intended, so it will occur.” — Isaiah 14:24</p>

                        <h2>Unshakable Promise of Deliverance</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s end-time promises—culminating in the Great Tribulation, Armageddon, and resurrection—are unshakable, as “he who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13). These events ensure His purpose prevails.</p>
                        <p><strong>Great Tribulation:</strong> A global crisis will test humanity, but Jehovah protects His faithful (Matthew 24:21-22). False religion’s fall precedes it (Revelation 17:16), fulfilling “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4).</p>
                        <p><strong>Armageddon:</strong> Jehovah’s war will destroy wickedness, as “he will bring to ruin those ruining the earth” (Revelation 11:18; 16:16). Christ leads heavenly armies to victory (Revelation 19:11-16).</p>
                        <p><strong>Resurrection:</strong> The dead will rise to life on a restored earth, as “all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out” (John 5:28-29). This hope anchors the faithful, as “God’s purpose will not be thwarted” (Isaiah 46:10).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> Trusting these promises, the faithful endure trials, knowing paradise awaits, as “the righteous will live forever on it” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“God will wipe out every tear from their eyes.” — Revelation 21:4</p>

                        <h2>Foundation of Certainty</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s unchanging attributes—justice, love, wisdom, power—form the unshakable foundation of His promises, as “I am Jehovah; I do not change” (Malachi 3:6). Unlike human rulers, Jehovah’s character guarantees His purpose.</p>
                        <p><strong>Divine Qualities:</strong> His justice ensures righteous judgment (Deuteronomy 32:4), His love promises mercy (1 John 4:8), His wisdom designs flawless plans (Romans 11:33), and His power overcomes all obstacles (Isaiah 40:26). When Jehovah delivered Israel from Egypt, His power parted the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21-22), proving “there is no one like Jehovah” (Exodus 15:11).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> Trusting Jehovah’s attributes helps the faithful remain steadfast, knowing He is “a stronghold in the day of distress” (Nahum 1:7).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I am Jehovah; I do not change.” — Malachi 3:6</p>

                        <h2>Guaranteed End of Babylon the Great</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s promise to destroy false religion, “Babylon the Great,” is unshakable, as “she will be completely burned with fire” (Revelation 18:8). This ensures pure worship’s triumph.</p>
                        <p><strong>Prophetic Certainty:</strong> Revelation foretells nations turning against false religion, stripping it bare (Revelation 17:16-17). Ancient Babylon’s fall in 539 BCE prefigured this, as Jehovah humbled its gods (Isaiah 46:1-2). False teachings like the Trinity and immortal soul will collapse, as “Jehovah is the true God” (Jeremiah 10:10).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> Knowing false religion’s end is near, the faithful reject its lies and worship Jehovah with “spirit and truth” (John 4:24).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Get out of her, my people.” — Revelation 18:4</p>

                        <p>Jehovah’s promise of a paradise earth, free from pain and death, is unshakable, as “God will wipe out every tear from their eyes” (Revelation 21:4). This hope anchors the faithful.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Vision:</strong> Isaiah foresaw a world where “the wolf and the lamb will feed together” (Isaiah 65:25), and Psalms promises “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11). Eden’s restoration is certain, as Jehovah’s purpose “will not be thwarted” (Isaiah 46:10).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> This hope sustains endurance through trials, inspiring the faithful to live for Jehovah’s new world, as “he that does the will of God remains forever” (1 John 2:17).</p>

                        <p>Jehovah’s promises equip the faithful to endure trials with unshakable faith, as “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid” (Hebrews 13:6). Practical steps and principles ensure steadfastness in persecution and modern challenges.</p>
                        <p><strong>Enduring Persecution:</strong> Like Daniel, who prayed despite bans (Daniel 6:10-23), the faithful face opposition, such as Russia’s 2017 restrictions, with courage, as “we must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29).</p>
                        <p><strong>Christian Conduct:</strong> Jehovah’s standards guide family life (Colossians 3:18-21), neutrality in conflicts (John 17:14), and honesty (Ephesians 4:25), ennobling daily actions, as “walk in the way of integrity” (Psalm 26:11).</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern Challenges:</strong> Rejecting materialism and secularism (1 John 2:15-17), the faithful rely on Bible study (Psalm 1:2-3), prayer (1 Thessalonians 5:17), and association (Hebrews 10:24-25), as “draw close to God, and he will draw close to you” (James 4:8).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> These steps build resilience, ensuring “the peace of God will guard your hearts” (Philippians 4:7).</p>

                        <p>The global preaching of Jehovah’s Kingdom, unstoppable despite opposition, proves His purpose is unshakable, as “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth” (Matthew 24:14). A united brotherhood strengthens this mission.</p>
                        <p><strong>Global Reach:</strong> Over 8.7 million faithful preach in 1,000+ languages, logging 1.4 billion hours annually, even under bans like Russia’s 2017 restriction. Conventions, like 2019’s “Love Never Fails,” unite millions, fulfilling “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10).</p>
                        <p><strong>Brotherhood’s Strength:</strong> The congregation fosters love and support, providing disaster relief and encouragement (Acts 2:42; Galatians 6:10). This unity reflects Jehovah’s purpose, as “by this all will know you are my disciples” (John 13:35).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> Joining this work and community strengthens faith, knowing “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
