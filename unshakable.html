                    <summary class="item-button">Enduring Persecution</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Unshakable faith endures persecution, “All those desiring to live with godly devotion will be persecuted” (2 Timothy 3:12), as Jesus commissioned, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). In 33 CE, Jesus warned, “You will be hated by all people” (Matthew 10:22), yet stood firm. Satan incites, “The dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah sustains, “I am with you” (Isaiah 41:10). True worshipers remain steadfast, “Be faithful even to death” (Revelation 2:10), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Stephen, martyred in 33 CE, “They could not withstand the wisdom” (Acts 6:10), faithful ones endure, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Deliver me from my enemies” (Psalm 59:1), and trust, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Strengthening Faith</h2>
                        <p>Faith grows through study, “Pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), and association, “Encourage one another” (Hebrews 10:25). Daniel’s resolve, “My God sent his angel” (Daniel 6:22), in 537 BCE, inspires. Worshipers stand firm, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Trusting Jehovah</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers trust Jehovah’s protection, “Jehovah is my helper” (Hebrews 13:6), and follow Jesus’ example, “I have conquered the world” (John 16:33). Their endurance prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Be faithful even to death.” —Revelation 2:10</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Facing Ridicule</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Unshakable faith withstands ridicule, “They will speak abusively of you” (1 Peter 4:4), while obeying, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). In 33 CE, Jesus endured mockery, “Others he saved; himself he cannot save” (Matthew 27:42), yet remained steadfast. Satan stirs scorn, “The god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah strengthens, “Do not be afraid” (Matthew 10:28). Worshipers stand firm, “We cannot stop speaking” (Acts 4:20), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Nehemiah, mocked in 455 BCE, “They kept ridiculing us” (Nehemiah 4:1), faithful ones persevere, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Give your servant courage” (Psalm 86:16), and focus, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Overcoming Mockery</h2>
                        <p>Overcoming requires boldness, “I am not ashamed of the good news” (Romans 1:16), and humility, “Do nothing out of contentiousness” (Philippians 2:3). Noah’s endurance, “A preacher of righteousness” (2 Peter 2:5), around 2370 BCE, inspires. Worshipers persist, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Maintaining Dignity</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers maintain dignity by kindness, “Be peaceable with all men” (Romans 12:18), and Jesus’ example, “He gave no answer” (Matthew 27:14). Their steadfastness prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“We cannot stop speaking.” —Acts 4:20</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Resisting Family Opposition</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Unshakable faith resists family opposition, “A man’s enemies will be those of his own household” (Matthew 10:36), while fulfilling, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). In 33 CE, Jesus faced division, “His brothers were not exercising faith in him” (John 7:5), yet persisted. Satan divides, “The dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah unites, “I am with you” (Isaiah 41:10). Worshipers prioritize Jehovah, “Whoever does the will of God is my brother” (Mark 3:35), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Timothy, whose faith stood firm despite family challenges, “From infancy you have known the holy writings” (2 Timothy 3:15), in 50 CE, faithful ones endure, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Create in me a clean heart” (Psalm 51:10), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Balancing Loyalties</h2>
                        <p>Balancing involves love, “Honor your father and your mother” (Ephesians 6:2), and obedience to God, “We must obey God rather than men” (Acts 5:29). Joseph’s loyalty, “How could I commit this great evil?” (Genesis 39:9), in 1711 BCE, inspires. Worshipers prioritize, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Showing Respect</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers show respect, “Let your words be seasoned with salt” (Colossians 4:6), and follow Jesus’ example, “I have not come to destroy but to fulfill” (Matthew 5:17). Their faith prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Whoever does the will of God is my brother.” —Mark 3:35</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Standing Firm in Trials</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Unshakable faith stands firm in trials, “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matthew 24:13), as Jesus urged, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). In 33 CE, Jesus faced trials, “He endured a torture stake” (Hebrews 12:2), yet obeyed. Satan tests, “The god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah strengthens, “Jehovah is my helper” (Hebrews 13:6). Worshipers endure, “Be faithful even to death” (Revelation 2:10), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Job, who endured loss around 1473 BCE, “Jehovah has given, and Jehovah has taken away” (Job 1:21), faithful ones persevere, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They study, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Building Endurance</h2>
                        <p>Endurance grows through prayer, “Do not stop praying” (1 Thessalonians 5:17), and association, “Not forsaking our meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25). Paul’s perseverance, “I have fought the fine fight” (2 Timothy 4:7), in 50 CE, inspires. Worshipers endure, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Relying on Jehovah</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers rely on Jehovah, “My strength and my fortress” (Psalm 18:2), and Jesus’ example, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit” (Luke 23:46). Their steadfastness prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The one who endures to the end will be saved.” —Matthew 24:13</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Overcoming Doubt</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Unshakable faith overcomes doubt, “This is the victory that has overcome the world, our faith” (1 John 5:4), while obeying, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). In 33 CE, Jesus reassured Thomas, “Stop being unbelieving, but become believing” (John 20:27), strengthening him. Satan sows uncertainty, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah clarifies, “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Worshipers trust, “Pay attention to the prophetic word” (2 Peter 1:19), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Gideon, who overcame doubt in 1107 BCE, “Jehovah is with you” (Judges 6:12), faithful ones seek truth, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They study, “This book of the Law should not depart” (Joshua 1:8), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Strengthening Conviction</h2>
                        <p>Conviction grows through meditation, “I will meditate on your orders” (Psalm 119:15), and prayer, “Open my eyes” (Psalm 119:18). Peter’s recovery, “Feed my lambs” (John 21:15), in 33 CE, inspires. Worshipers trust, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>

Their faith prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <p>Unshakable faith rejects worldly pressure, “Do not be conformed to this system of things” (Romans 12:2), while fulfilling, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). In 33 CE, Jesus resisted, “Get behind me, Satan!” (Matthew 16:23), prioritizing God’s will. Satan tempts, “The god of this system of things” (2 Corinthians 4:4), but Jehovah guides, “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105). Worshipers stand firm, “Flee from youthful desires” (2 Timothy 2:22), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Daniel’s companions, who defied idolatry in 607 BCE, “We will not serve your gods” (Daniel 3:18), faithful ones resist, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Do not bring us into temptation” (Matthew 6:13), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Guarding the Mind</h2>
                        <p>Guarding involves rejecting immorality, “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Corinthians 6:18), and falsehood, “Abhor what is wicked” (Romans 12:9). Esther’s stand, “If I perish, I perish” (Esther 4:16), in 475 BCE, inspires. Worshipers focus, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>
                        <h2>Living for Jehovah</h2>
                        <p>Worshipers live for Jehovah, “Seek first the Kingdom” (Matthew 6:33), and follow Jesus’ example, “I do not seek my own will” (John 5:30). Their resistance prepares for paradise, “The meek will inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5), where “Righteousness is to dwell” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Do not be conformed to this system of things.” —Romans 12:2</p>

                        <p>Unshakable faith maintains joy amid opposition, “Consider it all joy when you meet with various trials” (James 1:2), while obeying, “Go, therefore, and make disciples” (Matthew 28:19). In 50 CE, Paul and Silas sang in prison, “They were praying and praising God” (Acts 16:25), despite persecution. Satan discourages, “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” (1 John 5:19), but Jehovah uplifts, “The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold” (Nehemiah 8:10). Worshipers rejoice, “Serve Jehovah with rejoicing” (Psalm 100:2), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Habakkuk, who rejoiced in 607 BCE, “I will exult in Jehovah” (Habakkuk 3:18), faithful ones find joy, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Let my heart rejoice” (Psalm 13:5), ensuring “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30), preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
                        <h2>Finding Joy</h2>

The disciples’ joy, “They returned with great joy” (Luke 10:17), in 33 CE, inspires. Worshipers focus, “The one walking in integrity will be saved” (Proverbs 28:18).</p>

In 33 CE, Peter, tested, declared, “You are the Christ” (Matthew 16:16), despite pressure. Satan tests, “The dragon became enraged” (Revelation 12:17), but Jehovah rewards, “Those honoring me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Worshipers remain loyal, “Be faithful even to death” (Revelation 2:10), and preach, “This good news of the Kingdom” (Matthew 24:14), aligning with “The righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p>Like Abraham, tested in 1918 BCE, “By faith Abraham offered up Isaac” (Hebrews 11:17), faithful ones prove loyalty, “Get out of her, my people” (Revelation 18:4). They pray, “Do not bring us into temptation” (Matthew 6:13), ensuring steadfastness, preparing for “A new earth” (2 Peter 3:13).</p>
