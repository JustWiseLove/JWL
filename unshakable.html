            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Jehovah’s Kingdom: A Real Government</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Unshakable Rule Over Earth</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom is no mere concept but a real government, unshakable in its authority to transform earth, as “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed” (Daniel 2:44). Unlike human governments, which crumble under corruption, Jehovah’s Kingdom, ruled by Christ, ensures justice and peace (Isaiah 9:7).</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Evidence:</strong> Daniel foresaw a kingdom crushing all others, standing forever (Daniel 2:44-45). Jesus taught his followers to pray for this Kingdom (Matthew 6:10), and Revelation depicts Christ leading it to victory (Revelation 11:15). Its rule is certain, as “Jehovah of armies has sworn, ‘As I have intended, so it will occur’” (Isaiah 14:24).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> Amid political turmoil, the faithful find stability knowing Jehovah’s Kingdom will soon govern earth, fulfilling “the righteous will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:29).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” — Revelation 11:15</p>

            <div class="item">
                <details>
                    <summary class="item-button">Fulfilled Prophecies: Proof of Reliability</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Jehovah’s Word Never Fails</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s prophecies, fulfilled with precision, prove His promises are unshakable, as “not one word of all his good promises failed” (1 Kings 8:56). From ancient Israel to modern times, fulfilled predictions confirm Jehovah’s sovereignty.</p>
                        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Jeremiah foretold Jerusalem’s 70-year desolation (Jeremiah 25:11-12), fulfilled when Babylon fell in 539 BCE and Jews returned in 537 BCE (Ezra 1:1-3). Daniel’s prophecy of successive world powers—Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome—unfolded exactly (Daniel 2:31-43). In 1914, global war marked the “last days” foretold by Jesus (Matthew 24:7; 2 Timothy 3:1-5).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> These fulfillments assure the faithful that Jehovah’s future promises, like paradise, are certain, strengthening endurance, as “my word will not return to me without results” (Isaiah 55:11).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“As I have intended, so it will occur.” — Isaiah 14:24</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>Unshakable Against Opposition</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s Word remains unshakable despite centuries of attacks, as “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8). Satan’s efforts to suppress it have failed, proving its divine protection.</p>
                        <p><strong>Historical Resilience:</strong> In the 1st century, Roman emperors burned Christian writings, yet the Bible survived (Acts 8:1-4). In the Middle Ages, Catholic bans couldn’t stop vernacular translations (John 17:17). In modern times, bans in nations like Russia since 2017 have not silenced the truth, as “the word of God is not bound” (2 Timothy 2:9).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> The Bible’s endurance encourages the faithful to trust its guidance, knowing Jehovah preserves His truth for those who seek it (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The word of God is not bound.” — 2 Timothy 2:9</p>

                        <h2>Foundation of Certainty</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s unchanging attributes—justice, love, wisdom, power—form the unshakable foundation of His promises, as “I am Jehovah; I do not change” (Malachi 3:6). Unlike human rulers, Jehovah’s character guarantees His purpose.</p>
                        <p><strong>Divine Qualities:</strong> His justice ensures righteous judgment (Deuteronomy 32:4), His love promises mercy (1 John 4:8), His wisdom designs flawless plans (Romans 11:33), and His power overcomes all obstacles (Isaiah 40:26). When Jehovah delivered Israel from Egypt, His power parted the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21-22), proving “there is no one like Jehovah” (Exodus 15:11).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> Trusting Jehovah’s attributes helps the faithful remain steadfast, knowing He is “a stronghold in the day of distress” (Nahum 1:7).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“I am Jehovah; I do not change.” — Malachi 3:6</p>

                        <h2>Guaranteed End of Babylon the Great</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s promise to destroy false religion, “Babylon the Great,” is unshakable, as “she will be completely burned with fire” (Revelation 18:8). This ensures pure worship’s triumph.</p>
                        <p><strong>Prophetic Certainty:</strong> Revelation foretells nations turning against false religion, stripping it bare (Revelation 17:16-17). Ancient Babylon’s fall in 539 BCE prefigured this, as Jehovah humbled its gods (Isaiah 46:1-2). False teachings like the Trinity and immortal soul will collapse, as “Jehovah is the true God” (Jeremiah 10:10).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> Knowing false religion’s end is near, the faithful reject its lies and worship Jehovah with “spirit and truth” (John 4:24).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Get out of her, my people.” — Revelation 18:4</p>

                        <h2>Unshakable Hope for Eternity</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s promise of a paradise earth, free from pain and death, is unshakable, as “God will wipe out every tear from their eyes” (Revelation 21:4). This hope anchors the faithful.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Vision:</strong> Isaiah foresaw a world where “the wolf and the lamb will feed together” (Isaiah 65:25), and Psalms promises “the meek will possess the earth” (Psalm 37:11). Eden’s restoration is certain, as Jehovah’s purpose “will not be thwarted” (Isaiah 46:10).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Assurance:</strong> This hope sustains endurance through trials, inspiring the faithful to live for Jehovah’s new world, as “he that does the will of God remains forever” (1 John 2:17).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.” — Psalm 37:29</p>

                        <h2>Remaining Unshakable in Trials</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s promises equip the faithful to endure trials with unshakable faith, as “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid” (Hebrews 13:6). Practical steps rooted in scripture ensure steadfastness.</p>
                        <p><strong>Biblical Examples:</strong> Job endured loss and sickness, trusting Jehovah’s justice (Job 1:21; 42:10). Paul faced imprisonment yet rejoiced in Jehovah’s strength (Philippians 4:13). Their faith proves “the peace of God will guard your hearts” (Philippians 4:7).</p>
                        <p><strong>Practical Steps:</strong> Regular Bible study (Psalm 1:2-3), prayer (1 Thessalonians 5:17), and association with the faithful (Hebrews 10:24-25) build resilience, as “draw close to God, and he will draw close to you” (James 4:8).</p>

                        <h2>Unshakable Mission Fulfills Prophecy</h2>
                        <p>The global preaching of Jehovah’s Kingdom, unstoppable despite opposition, proves His purpose is unshakable, as “this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern Evidence:</strong> Over 8.7 million faithful preach in 1,000+ languages, logging 1.4 billion hours annually, even under bans like Russia’s 2017 restriction. Conventions, like 2019’s “Love Never Fails,” unite millions, fulfilling “You are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10).</p>
