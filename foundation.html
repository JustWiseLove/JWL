                        <h2>Satan’s Deception in Eden</h2>
                        <p>False worship ignited when Satan, as a serpent, deceived Eve into thinking she could be like God and judge right from wrong independently (Genesis 3:1-6), introducing idolatry by placing self or other gods above Jehovah, who demands sole devotion (Exodus 20:3). This rebellion spread to Cain, whose rejected sacrifice and murder of Abel defied Jehovah’s standards (Genesis 4:3-8). Sumerian tablets from 3000 BCE, listing gods like Enki with blood offerings, show polytheism’s rapid rise after Eden.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “You must not have any other gods besides me.” 
                            <cite>—Exodus 20:3</cite>
                        </div>
                        <h2>The Golden Calf Incident</h2>
                        <p>Fresh from Egypt’s deliverance, the Israelites forged a golden calf, blending Jehovah’s worship with Egyptian bull god Apis practices, incurring about 3,000 deaths as punishment (Exodus 32:4-6, 28), a mix Deuteronomy 12:31 calls detestable. Hazor’s calf figurines from 1400 BCE confirm this idolatry’s spread. It warns against tainting Jehovah’s worship with human traditions.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “Every detestable thing that Jehovah hates, they have done.” 
                            <cite>—Deuteronomy 12:31</cite>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Baal Worship and Sacrifices</h2>
                        <p>Baal worship lured Israel into child sacrifice, an act Jehovah never imagined (Jeremiah 19:5), led by kings like Ahab with altars and poles (1 Kings 16:31-32), bringing ruin and judgment. Carthage urns from 800 BCE, holding diseased infant bones, show no blessing, only horror. This reveals Satan’s grip pulling people from Jehovah’s life-giving way.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “They built the high places of Baal... to make their sons and daughters pass through the fire.”

                        </div>
                        <h2>Ancestor Worship’s Rise</h2>
                        <p>Ancestor worship defied Jehovah’s truth about death, with Egyptians mummifying pharaohs as gods by 2600 BCE, misreading Enoch (Genesis 5:24; Hebrews 11:13 says he died), and China’s Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE) consulting the dead via oracle bones, despite Ecclesiastes 9:5’s “the dead know nothing.” EEGs confirm consciousness ends at death, exposing this early falsehood.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “The living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all.”

                        <h2>Christmas and Paganism</h2>
                        <p>Christmas, pegged to December 25, stems from Saturnalia, a Roman sun god festival with feasts, gifts, and evergreens (Pliny, 77 CE), not Jesus’ birth—Luke 2:8’s shepherds suggest a warmer season—shunned by early Christians like Tertullian (200 CE) as pagan. Jehovah demands separation (2 Corinthians 6:17), yet trees and presents persist, echoing idolatry.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “Get out from among them, and separate yourselves... and quit touching the unclean thing.” 
                            <cite>—2 Corinthians 6:17</cite>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Easter’s Fertility Rites</h2>
                        <p>Easter mixes Jesus’ resurrection with Eostre’s fertility rites—eggs and rabbits from Saxon spring festivals (Bede, 725 CE)—unsupported by Scripture’s weekly meetings (Acts 20:7) or symbols, with Germanic rabbit icons from 500 CE predating Christianity. Jehovah rejects man-made worship (Matthew 15:9), yet egg hunts continue.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “In vain they worship me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.” 
                            <cite>—Matthew 15:9</cite>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Halloween and Spiritism</h2>
                        <p>Halloween derives from Samhain, a Celtic dead-honoring festival banned as spiritism (Deuteronomy 18:10-12), with costumes and turnips from 900 CE Ireland, later tied to All Saints’ Day (835 CE). Leviticus 19:31 forbids spirit contact, yet trick-or-treating upholds this pagan rite.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “There should not be found in you anyone who... consults the dead.” 
                            <cite>—Deuteronomy 18:10-11</cite>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Birthdays’ Pagan Roots</h2>
                        <p>Birthdays in Scripture—Pharaoh’s (Genesis 40:20-22) with an execution, Herod’s (Mark 6:21-28) with John’s beheading—link to pagan death, not joy, with Greek Artemis candles (Herodotus, 450 BCE) rejected by Christians like Origen (250 CE). Ecclesiastes 7:1 favors death’s day, yet parties mimic false gods.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “The day of death is better than the day of birth.” 
                            <cite>—Ecclesiastes 7:1</cite>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Temple Commerce Today</h2>
                        <p>Jesus expelled temple merchants twice—early with a whip (John 2:13-16) and later flipping tables (Matthew 21:12-13)—calling it a “cave of robbers” (Jeremiah 7:11), not prayer, as Roman records (30 CE) note market activity. Modern church yard sales repeat this misuse.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a cave of robbers.” 
                            <cite>—Matthew 21:13</cite>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Fate and Astrology</h2>
                        <p>Fate via astrology claims a fixed destiny, unlike Jehovah’s free will offer—“choose life” (Deuteronomy 30:19), “choose whom you serve” (Joshua 24:15)—with Babylonians (2000 BCE) mapping stars, debunked by science showing no celestial sway. Horoscopes mislead, denying choice.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “I have put life and death before you... choose life.” 
                            <cite>—Deuteronomy 30:19</cite>
                        </div>
                        <h2>The Cross Symbol</h2>
                        <p>The cross, a pagan symbol for Tammuz (1500 BCE), not Jesus’ stake (*stauros*, Galatians 3:13), violates Exodus 20:4’s image ban, adopted by Constantine (312 CE) per Eusebius. Early Christians shunned it; today’s jewelry honors falsehood, not Jehovah.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “You must not make for yourself a carved image.”

                        <h2>Judaism’s Rejection of Jesus</h2>
                        <p>Judaism honors Jehovah but denies Jesus as Messiah, missing Isaiah 53’s suffering servant from the Dead Sea Scrolls (150 BCE), fulfilled in Christ (John 14:6), adding Talmud traditions like Hanukkah (200-500 CE) not in Scripture. Masada’s synagogues (70 CE) show Law devotion, not Jehovah’s full plan.</p>

                        <h2>Buddhism’s Godless Quest</h2>
                        <p>Buddhism seeks nirvana, ignoring Jehovah as Creator (Revelation 4:11), with Siddhartha’s 500 BCE teachings unproven—relics like Buddha’s tooth lack evidence, and science (EEGs) refutes reincarnation. It’s a godless path, missing Jehovah’s truth.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">

                        <h2>Hinduism’s Polytheistic Maze</h2>
                        <p>Hinduism’s many gods—Vishnu, Shiva—clash with Exodus 20:3, its Vedas (1200 BCE) pushing reincarnation against Genesis 3:19’s dust return and Cambrian sudden life (540 million years ago). Angkor Wat (1100 CE) lacks rebirth proof, veiling Jehovah’s light.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “You must not have any other gods besides me.”

                        <h2>Islam’s Denial of the Ransom</h2>
                        <p>Islam’s Allah omits Jesus’ ransom (John 17:3), denying his death (Quran 4:157), with Muhammad’s 610 CE revelations tied to the pagan Kaaba (Ibn Hisham, 800 CE) and a flat-earth hint (Quran 71:19) lagging Job 26:7. It misses Jehovah’s plan.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”

                        <h2>Catholicism’s Human Traditions</h2>
                        <p>Catholicism’s saint prayers and Trinity lack Scrolls (1947) support, defying 1 Timothy 2:5’s one mediator, Jesus, with Constantine’s cross (312 CE) and Trent (1545) adding paganism, unlike early Christians (Justin Martyr, 150 CE). It clouds Jehovah’s worship.</p>

                        <p>Satan rules now (1 John 5:19), deceiving since Eden (John 8:44), with empires like Babylon and Rome falling (Revelation 11:15) and man’s wars since Sumer (3000 BCE) failing, soon ended by Jehovah’s Kingdom (Daniel 2:44).</p>

                        </div>
                        <h2>The Trinity Doctrine</h2>
                        <p>Trinity, from Nicaea (325 CE), mimics pagan triads (e.g., Ninurta-Nergal), not Scripture—John 17:3 names Jehovah alone true God, 1 Corinthians 11:3 ranks Him above Christ, rejected by early Christians (Justin Martyr, 150 CE).</p>

                        <h2>Hellfire’s False Fear</h2>
                        <p>Hellfire contradicts Ezekiel 18:4—“the soul who sins will die”—from Greek Hades and Dante (1320), not Bible, with EEGs showing death ends awareness, exposing Satan’s scare tactic against Jehovah’s justice.</p>

                        <div class="scripture">
                            “There is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave.”

                        <p>Satan’s lie of evolution claims life morphed from simple to complex, yet Genesis 1:25 declares Jehovah created kinds distinctly—no fossil record shows in-between stages, with the Cambrian Explosion (540 million years ago) revealing sudden, fully formed species, not gradual shifts, while Darwin’s hoped-for transitions (e.g., fish-to-amphibian) remain absent, exposing this theory as a baseless myth.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “God went on to make the wild animals of the earth according to their kinds.”

                        <h2>Babylon the Great—False Religion United</h2>
                        <p>Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, misleads mankind away from Jehovah (Revelation 18:2-4). From ancient Babylon’s gods to today’s divided churches, it unites all who reject Bible truth, riding political powers (Revelation 17:3-5) and spreading lies about God’s name, hellfire, and the soul. Jehovah calls His people to flee her before she’s destroyed.</p>

                        <p>Genesis 1’s days—light, atmosphere, land, sun, sea life, animals—match earth’s stages, with Cambrian Explosion (540 million years ago) showing sudden “kinds,” no evolution fossils (e.g., fish-to-amphibian), refuting Darwin and shining as Jehovah’s truth.</p>

                        <h2>History Proves Accuracy</h2>
                        <p>The Bible’s history shines true—Daniel 2 predicts Babylon’s fall to Cyrus (539 BCE), named in Isaiah 44:28 150 years prior, while Daniel 8:5-7 foresaw Alexander the Great’s conquest (331 BCE), confirmed by Persian and Greek records like the Cyrus Cylinder and Arrian’s histories, unmatched by any human text.</p>

                        <p>Dead Sea Scrolls (1947) affirm Scripture—Isaiah (150 BCE) matches today, 900 manuscripts (250 BCE-70 CE) confirm Daniel 9:24-26’s Jesus prediction, shining eternally (1 Peter 1:25) unlike shifting human works.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">

                        <h2>Jehovah’s Original Purpose</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah planned Paradise Earth (Genesis 1:28), undone by Satan’s lie, not His will—man’s self-rule fails, with wars since Sumer (3000 BCE), but Psalm 37:11 and Jesus’ ransom (John 17:3) restore it.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”

                        </div>
                        <h2>Satan’s Expulsion from Heaven</h2>
                        <p>In 1914, Jesus cast Satan down to earth, fulfilling Revelation 12:7-9. This triggered the “woe for the earth,” seen in global conflict and unrest. Satan knows his time is short—Jehovah’s Kingdom will soon end his influence forever.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of time.”

                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom will resurrect billions to life on earth (John 5:28-29), fulfilling His promise to undo death. Faithful ones from all times will return to a peaceful world, guided by accurate knowledge (Isaiah 26:19), showing Jehovah’s perfect justice and love.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">

                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom ends death (Revelation 21:4), reviving Eden—fossils (300 million years old) hint at its past—where homes and vineyards thrive (Isaiah 65:21-22) and animals live peacefully (Isaiah 11:6-9), surpassing man’s chaos.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">

                        <h2>Everlasting Life Ahead</h2>
                        <p>Paradise brings eternal life—Psalm 133:3’s dew-like renewal, health from Leviticus’ laws (science-approved), death gone (1 Corinthians 15:26), and resurrection (John 5:28-29) under Jehovah’s knowledge (Isaiah 11:9), outshining man’s ruin.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">

                        <p>Jehovah’s Kingdom crushes man’s rule (Daniel 2:44), spreading His knowledge (Isaiah 11:9)—faith’s peace shines now (studies confirm)—urging choice of truth (Proverbs 23:23) via Jesus (John 14:6) over Satan’s failure.</p>

                        <h2>Using Jehovah’s Name</h2>
                        <p>Jesus imitated Jehovah by making His name known, praying “I have made your name manifest” (John 17:6) and teaching its use (Matthew 6:9), echoing its 7,000+ Bible mentions (Psalm 83:18), unlike 3rd-century CE removals (Codex Sinaiticus). We follow by boldly saying “Jehovah” in worship.</p>

                        </div>
                        <h2>Bible Over Traditions</h2>
                        <p>Jesus prioritized Scripture over traditions, rebuking Pharisees for nullifying God’s Word with rules (Mark 7:13), teaching from the Law and Prophets (Luke 4:16-17), not man-made creeds. We imitate him by studying the Bible daily, rejecting holiday rituals.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “You make the word of God invalid by your tradition.”

                        <h2>Sharing Truth House-to-House</h2>
                        <p>Jesus shared truth personally, teaching in homes and villages (Luke 8:1), a model his disciples followed house-to-house (Acts 20:20), unlike distant clergy of his day. We follow by knocking on doors, offering Jehovah’s hope directly.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">

                        <h2>No War or Politics</h2>
                        <p>Jesus avoided war and politics, saying “my Kingdom is no part of this world” (John 18:36) and refusing Satan’s rule (Matthew 4:8-10), unlike zealots of 30 CE. We imitate by staying neutral, loving enemies (Matthew 5:44), not fighting or voting.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">

                        <p>Jesus taught a narrow path to life, saying “few are finding it” (Matthew 7:13-14), unlike broad, popular religions blending paganism and lies—Jehovah’s Witnesses alone walk this tight road, rejecting worldly ways for Bible truth since 1870s studies by Charles Taze Russell.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">

                        <p>Jesus warned that not all saying “Lord, Lord” enter the Kingdom, only those doing Jehovah’s will (Matthew 7:21-23)—Jehovah’s Witnesses stand apart, obeying God’s laws over man’s, unlike churches claiming faith yet steeped in 4th-century CE pagan creeds.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">
                            “Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, but only the one doing the will of my Father.”

                        <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses use only the Bible, as 2 Timothy 3:16 declares it sufficient, rejecting added books like the Talmud, Quran, or catechisms—since 1931, their New World Translation restores Jehovah’s name, unlike religions diluting truth with human texts.</p>
                        <div class="scripture">

                        <div class="scripture">
                            “The true worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth.”

                        <div class="scripture">
                            “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them... teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded.”

Named His witnesses (Isaiah 43:10), their fruits since 1919 show Jehovah’s blessing.</p>
