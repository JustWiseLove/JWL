                        <p>Jehovah’s inspired Word in Hebrew anchors true worship, as “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16).</p>
                        <p><strong>Original Manuscripts:</strong> Written by Moses and prophets, these texts used “YHWH” 6,973 times, proclaiming “I am Jehovah, that is my name” (Isaiah 42:8). Scribes ensured accuracy, fulfilling “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <h3>Historical Support</h3>
                        <p>The Silver Scrolls (c. 600 BCE, Israel Museum) confirm “YHWH” in daily use. Radiocarbon dating validates their antiquity, proving scribal fidelity.</p>

                        <p>The Septuagint brought Jehovah’s Word to Greek-speaking Jews, preserving His name, as “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <p><strong>Septuagint (LXX):</strong> Translated in Alexandria, Egypt, it retained “YHWH” in Hebrew characters, as seen in Papyrus Fouad 266 (2nd century BCE, Cairo Museum), resisting the use of “Kyrios” (Lord).</p>
                        <h3>Scientific Support</h3>
                        <p>Paleographic analysis dates these fragments to the 2nd century BCE, confirming authenticity. Its spread strengthened worship among diaspora Jews.</p>

                        <p>The Dead Sea Scrolls safeguarded Jehovah’s Word against corruption, as “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p><strong>Qumran Manuscripts:</strong> Found in 1947–1956, these 900+ scrolls include “YHWH” in paleo-Hebrew script, as in the Great Isaiah Scroll (Israel Museum, Jerusalem). They confirm the Hebrew text’s purity.</p>
                        <h3>Scientific Support</h3>
                        <p>Carbon-14 dating places the scrolls between 200 BCE and 70 CE, verifying their age. Their alignment with Masoretic texts proves scribal precision.</p>

                        <p>Greek codices preserved Jehovah’s Word as apostasy grew, as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>
                        <p><strong>Codex Sinaiticus:</strong> Found at Mount Sinai, it retains traces of “YHWH” in Old Testament quotes (British Library, London). <strong>Codex Vaticanus:</strong> Stored in the Vatican, it preserves texts where “YHWH” appeared, though using “Kyrios.”</p>
                        <h3>Scientific Support</h3>
                        <p>Paleographic studies date these to the 4th century, confirming their early origin. Their texts align with the Septuagint, ensuring reliability.</p>

                        <h2>(c. 382–405 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Vulgate spread Jehovah’s Word in Latin but obscured His name, as “the word of God is alive” yet requires clarity (Hebrews 4:12).</p>
                        <p><strong>Jerome’s Vulgate:</strong> Translated by Jerome in Bethlehem, it replaced “YHWH” with “Dominus” (Lord). Preserved in the Vatican Library, it dominated for centuries.</p>
                        <h3>Historical Support</h3>
                        <p>Manuscripts like Codex Amiatinus (8th century, Florence) show its influence. Its widespread use shaped medieval worship, despite the name’s absence.</p>

                        <h2>(1382–1885 CE)</h2>
                        <p>Early modern translations made Jehovah’s Word accessible but introduced errors, as “Your word is truth” demands precision (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p><strong>Wycliffe Bible (1382):</strong> The first English Bible, based on the Vulgate, used “Lord” instead of “YHWH,” obscuring “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). Its handwritten copies (British Library) were banned for challenging church authority.</p>
                        <p><strong>Tyndale Bible (1526):</strong> William Tyndale used “Jehovah” in places (e.g., Exodus 6:3), defying bans. Executed in 1536, his work (British Library) influenced later Bibles but relied on limited manuscripts.</p>
                        <p><strong>Geneva Bible (1560):</strong> Popular among Puritans, it used “LORD” and included Calvinist notes, introducing bias. Its reliance on the Textus Receptus limited accuracy (British Library).</p>
                        <p><strong>King James Version (1611):</strong> Commissioned by King James I, it used “LORD” except in four places (e.g., Psalm 83:18). Based on the Textus Receptus, it includes additions like 1 John 5:7, absent in early manuscripts (e.g., Sinaiticus), and archaic language confuses readers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Revised Version (1885):</strong> Aimed to update the KJV, it retained “LORD” and relied on newer manuscripts but introduced inconsistent renderings, weakening clarity.</p>
                        <h3>Common Faults</h3>
                        <p>1. <strong>Removal of Jehovah’s Name:</strong> Replacing “YHWH” with “Lord” hides “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).<br>
                        2. <strong>Spurious Texts:</strong> Additions like 1 John 5:7, likely copyist notes, appear in later manuscripts but not in early codices.<br>
                        3. <strong>Limited Manuscripts:</strong> Reliance on late sources (e.g., Textus Receptus) ignores older texts like the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br>
                        4. <strong>Doctrinal Bias or Archaic Language:</strong> Notes (Geneva) or outdated terms (KJV) obscure “Your word is a lamp” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <h3>Historical Support</h3>
                        <p>Textual criticism, comparing these to codices like Vaticanus (4th century), reveals their flaws. Their influence (e.g., KJV’s global spread) contrasts with their inaccuracies.</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(1901–Present)</h2>
                        <p>Modern translations gained popularity but strayed from Jehovah’s truth, as “all Scripture is inspired” requires fidelity (2 Timothy 3:16).</p>
                        <p><strong>American Standard Version (1901):</strong> Restored “Jehovah” in the Old Testament but used “Lord” in New Testament quotes, diluting “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). It retained questionable texts (e.g., Mark 16:9-20).</p>
                        <p><strong>Revised Standard Version (1952):</strong> Used “LORD” broadly, with “Jehovah” in rare cases. Its liberal renderings (e.g., Isaiah 7:14 as “young woman”) sparked controversy for weakening prophecy.</p>
                        <p><strong>New American Standard Bible (NASB, 1971):</strong> More literal, it still used “LORD” and included spurious texts (e.g., John 7:53–8:11), unsupported by early manuscripts like Sinaiticus.</p>
                        <p><strong>New International Version (NIV, 1978):</strong> Popular but flawed, it omits “Jehovah,” uses dynamic equivalence (paraphrasing), and retains additions (e.g., Mark 16:9-20), reducing fidelity to “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p><strong>New King James Version (NKJV, 1982):</strong> Updates the KJV but retains “LORD” and errors like 1 John 5:7, ignoring older manuscripts like the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
                        <p><strong>English Standard Version (ESV, 2001):</strong> Literal but uses “LORD” and includes questionable texts, failing to reflect “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <h3>Common Faults</h3>
                        <p>1. <strong>Removal of Jehovah’s Name:</strong> Substituting “LORD” obscures Jehovah’s identity.<br>
                        2. <strong>Spurious Additions:</strong> Texts like 1 John 5:7 and John 7:53–8:11, likely marginal notes, lack early manuscript support.<br>
                        3. <strong>Inaccurate Sources:</strong> Over-reliance on later manuscripts ignores older, reliable texts.<br>
                        4. <strong>Paraphrasing:</strong> NIV’s loose renderings sacrifice precision, unlike “Your word is a lamp” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <h3>Historical Support</h3>
                        <p>Textual criticism reveals their reliance on late manuscripts. The NIV’s 450 million copies show influence, but comparison to codices like Vaticanus highlights inaccuracies.</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">New World Translation: Pinnacle of Accuracy</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(1950–2013 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The New World Translation (NWT) restores Jehovah’s Word with unmatched precision, fulfilling “I will purify the lips of the peoples” (Zephaniah 3:9).</p>
                        <p><strong>New World Translation:</strong> Released in stages (1950–1961, revised 2013), it uses “Jehovah” 7,237 times—6,973 in the Hebrew Scriptures and 264 in the Christian Scriptures—based on the Leningrad Codex, Dead Sea Scrolls, and over 5,000 Greek manuscripts. Over 240 million copies in 200+ languages ensure global reach.</p>
                        <h3>Why the NWT is Most Accurate</h3>
                        <p>1. <strong>Restoration of Jehovah’s Name:</strong> The NWT restores “Jehovah” in the Christian Scriptures where Old Testament quotes (e.g., Matthew 4:4 citing Deuteronomy 8:3) or context (e.g., Acts 2:21) indicate “YHWH” was used. Early Septuagint fragments (e.g., Papyrus Fouad 266, 2nd century BCE) and Hebrew Gospel manuscripts (e.g., Shem-Tob’s Matthew, 14th century copying earlier texts) show “YHWH” in the 1st century. Later scribes substituted “Kyrios” due to Jewish traditions avoiding the divine name, but the NWT corrects this, fulfilling “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).<br>
                        2. <strong>Exclusion of Spurious Texts:</strong> The NWT omits passages absent in the oldest manuscripts (e.g., Codex Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, 4th century), such as 1 John 5:7 (“Father, Word, Holy Ghost”), Mark 16:9-20, John 7:53–8:11, and the Comma Johanneum. These were likely marginal notes or glosses added by copyists, not inspired text. For example, Mark 16:9-20 appears in later manuscripts (5th century) but not in Sinaiticus, ensuring “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).<br>
                        3. <strong>Fidelity to Original Texts:</strong> It uses the Aleppo and Leningrad Codices for the Hebrew Scriptures and early Greek manuscripts (e.g., Papyrus P46, 2nd century) for the Christian Scriptures, aligning with “all Scripture is inspired” (2 Timothy 3:16).<br>
                        4. <strong>Clear, Modern Language:</strong> Precise English clarifies meaning for all, as “Your word is a lamp” (Psalm 119:105).<br>
                        5. <strong>Scholarly Rigor:</strong> Cross-references thousands of manuscripts, avoiding doctrinal bias, unlike translations swayed by tradition (e.g., NIV’s paraphrasing).</p>
                        <h3>Scientific and Historical Support</h3>
                        <p>Textual criticism confirms the NWT’s alignment with the Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-dated to 200 BCE–70 CE) and codices like Sinaiticus (paleography-dated to 325 CE). Archaeological finds, like the Moabite Stone (840 BCE, Louvre), affirm “YHWH”’s prominence. The NWT’s distribution fulfills “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
