                        <h2>(c. 1500–400 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>Jehovah’s inspired Word, written primarily in Hebrew with some Aramaic sections, forms the bedrock of true worship, as declared in “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16). This collection, known as the Tanakh, encompasses the Law (Torah), Prophets (Nevi’im), and Writings (Ketuvim), totaling 39 books. The process began with Moses, who recorded the Law after receiving divine instruction at Mount Sinai, including the Ten Commandments inscribed by Jehovah Himself on stone tablets (Exodus 31:18). Over centuries, prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel, guided by holy spirit, added prophetic visions and historical accounts, ensuring the text reflected Jehovah’s will. The divine name “YHWH” appears 6,973 times, a testament to its centrality, as affirmed by “I am Jehovah, that is my name” (Isaiah 42:8). Scribes, known as Sopherim, meticulously copied these texts, counting letters to prevent errors, a practice that preserved the integrity of “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25) for generations.</p>
                        <p>The Hebrew Scriptures served as the spiritual foundation for Israel, guiding their covenant relationship with Jehovah. The Torah outlined laws for worship, morality, and governance, while the Prophets delivered messages of judgment, hope, and restoration, often predicting the Messiah. The Writings included poetic works like Psalms and wisdom literature like Proverbs, offering praise and practical guidance. These texts were written on scrolls made of parchment or papyrus, stored in synagogues and the temple, and read aloud during gatherings, reinforcing communal faith. Archaeological evidence, such as the Silver Scrolls from Ketef Hinnom (dated to around 600 BCE using radiocarbon analysis), bear priestly blessings with “YHWH,” confirming the name’s everyday use among the faithful. This enduring preservation underscores the scriptures’ divine origin and purpose, fulfilling “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8).</p>

                        <h2>(c. 280–150 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>The Septuagint, or LXX, marked a pivotal expansion of Jehovah’s Word into the Greek language, serving Greek-speaking Jews in the Hellenistic world, as promised in “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6). Commissioned in Alexandria, Egypt, around 280 BCE under Ptolemy II Philadelphus, legend holds that 70 (or 72) Jewish scholars translated the Hebrew Scriptures into Koine Greek over 70 days, ensuring accessibility for the diaspora. This translation retained “YHWH” in Hebrew characters within the text, as evidenced by fragments like Papyrus Fouad 266 (dated to the 2nd century BCE through paleographic analysis), resisting the later trend of substituting “Kyrios” (Lord). The Septuagint included not only the 39 books of the Hebrew Scriptures but also additional writings, known as the Apocrypha, which were valued for historical and moral insight though not considered divinely inspired.</p>
                        <p>The Septuagint’s creation responded to the cultural shift following Alexander the Great’s conquests, where Greek became the lingua franca. It facilitated worship and study among Jews outside Judea, with synagogues using it for readings. The translation process involved careful comparison with Hebrew scrolls, though some variations emerged due to interpretive choices or textual differences. For instance, Isaiah 7:14 translates “almah” (young woman) as “parthenos” (virgin), influencing later Christian interpretations of the Messiah’s birth. This Greek version became the Bible of early Christians, quoted extensively in the Christian Scriptures (e.g., Matthew 1:23), and its preservation in manuscripts like Codex Sinaiticus highlights its enduring role. The retention of “YHWH” in early copies underscores its sanctity, fulfilling “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Dead Sea Scrolls: Preserving Purity</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(c. 200 BCE–70 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered between 1947 and 1956 in the Qumran caves near the Dead Sea, stand as a monumental preservation of Jehovah’s Word, affirming “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Written by a Jewish sect, likely the Essenes, these 900+ manuscripts include nearly every book of the Hebrew Scriptures, with the Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa^a) being the most complete. Composed on parchment and papyrus between 200 BCE and 70 CE, as confirmed by carbon-14 dating, they feature “YHWH” in paleo-Hebrew script to distinguish it from other terms, reflecting deep reverence, as seen in Isaiah 42:8: “I am Jehovah, that is my name.” These scrolls were likely hidden during the First Jewish-Roman War to protect them from destruction, offering a snapshot of the text before the temple’s fall in 70 CE.</p>
                        <p>The scrolls reveal a community devoted to scriptural study and purity, living ascetic lives in anticipation of the end times. They include biblical texts, sectarian writings (e.g., the Community Rule), and commentaries (e.g., Pesher Habakkuk), showing how the Essenes interpreted prophecy. Remarkably, the Isaiah Scroll aligns closely with the Masoretic Text (e.g., Leningrad Codex, 1008 CE), with only minor variations, demonstrating scribal accuracy over a millennium. Some scrolls also contain hymns and apocalyptic visions, enriching understanding of Second Temple Judaism. Housed in the Israel Museum’s Shrine of the Book and the Jordan Museum, these artifacts, validated by paleographic and radiocarbon analysis (200 BCE–70 CE), confirm the Hebrew text’s stability, fulfilling “My words will not pass away” (Matthew 24:35).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Early Codices: Enduring Amid Apostasy</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(c. 325–350 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Early Codices, including Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, preserved Jehovah’s Word during a period of growing apostasy, as “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25). These were among the first complete Christian Bibles, written on vellum in a codex format (bound pages rather than scrolls), marking a shift in book production. Codex Sinaiticus, discovered in the 19th century at Saint Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai and now in the British Library, dates to around 325–350 CE based on paleographic analysis. Codex Vaticanus, held in the Vatican Library, is similarly dated to the mid-4th century. Both contain the Septuagint (Old Testament) and the Christian Scriptures, though with some textual differences reflecting early copying practices.</p>
                        <p>These codices were likely produced by Christian scribes in a time when the church faced pressures from pagan Roman culture and internal doctrinal disputes. Codex Sinaiticus occasionally retains “YHWH” in Hebrew script within Old Testament quotes, suggesting awareness of the divine name’s original presence, while Vaticanus uses “Kyrios” (Lord) more consistently, indicating a shift influenced by Jewish traditions avoiding the name. The texts include the 27 books of the Christian Scriptures, though with variations—Sinaiticus omits the longer ending of Mark (16:9-20), absent in its earliest form, while Vaticanus lacks some pastoral epistles. Their creation reflects efforts to standardize the canon, serving as foundational manuscripts for later translations. Their preservation, despite apostate trends, fulfills “I am Jehovah, that is my name” (Isaiah 42:8).</p>

                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(c. 382–405 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Latin Vulgate, translated by Jerome between 382 and 405 CE, became the dominant Bible of the Western Church, yet it obscured Jehovah’s name, as “the word of God is alive” requires clarity (Hebrews 4:12). Commissioned by Pope Damasus I, Jerome worked in Bethlehem, consulting Hebrew and Greek manuscripts to revise the earlier Old Latin translations. The result, completed around 405 CE, replaced “YHWH” with “Dominus” (Lord) throughout, reflecting a growing tradition among Jews and Christians to avoid pronouncing the divine name due to reverence or superstition. This Vulgate included the 39 books of the Hebrew Scriptures, the 27 Christian Scriptures, and the Deuterocanonical books (e.g., Tobit, Maccabees), which were valued in Catholic tradition though not part of the original Hebrew canon.</p>
                        <p>Jerome’s translation aimed to unify the church’s liturgy and scripture reading, using a clear, standardized Latin for a multilingual Roman Empire. He relied on the Hebrew Masoretic Text for the Old Testament, departing from the Septuagint where it diverged, and Greek manuscripts for the New Testament, producing a text that shaped medieval theology. Manuscripts like the Codex Amiatinus (early 8th century, Florence) preserve this work, showing its widespread use in monasteries and churches. However, the omission of “YHWH” marked a departure from the original intent, influencing later translations like the King James Version. Despite this flaw, its durability—copied by hand for centuries—underscored “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105), though it carried the burden of human alteration.</p>

                        <h2>(1382–1885 CE)</h2>
                        <p><h3>1. Wycliffe Bible (1382):</h3> The first English Bible, translated by John Wycliffe and his followers, relied on the Latin Vulgate, using “Lord” instead of “YHWH,” obscuring “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). Handwritten due to the ban on printing, its copies (British Library) were condemned by the church, leading to Wycliffe’s posthumous excommunication. This controversial effort aimed to make scripture accessible to the laity, sparking early reformist ideas.</p>
                        <p><h3>2. Tyndale Bible (1526):</h3> William Tyndale’s translation, the first printed English Bible, used “Jehovah” in places (e.g., Exodus 6:3), defying bans. Executed in 1536, his work (British Library) drew from Hebrew and Greek texts, influencing later versions, though its reliance on limited manuscripts introduced minor inaccuracies.</p>
                        <p><h3>3. Geneva Bible (1560):</h3> Popular among Puritans, this translation used “LORD” and included Calvinist notes, adding doctrinal bias. Based on the Textus Receptus (a 16th-century Greek text), it spread widely but lacked the precision of older manuscripts (British Library).</p>
                        <p><h3>4. King James Version (1611):</h3> Commissioned by King James I, it used “LORD” except in four places (e.g., Psalm 83:18). Relying on the Textus Receptus, it included spurious additions like 1 John 5:7, absent in early codices (e.g., Sinaiticus), and its archaic language confuses modern readers.</p>
                        <p><h3>5. Revised Version (1885):</h3> An attempt to update the KJV, it retained “LORD” and used newer manuscripts, but inconsistent renderings weakened its clarity, reflecting a compromise between tradition and scholarship.</p>
                        <p>These translations faced common issues: replacing “YHWH” with “Lord,” including spurious texts (e.g., 1 John 5:7), relying on late manuscripts, and using biased notes or outdated terms, hindering “Your word is a lamp” (Psalm 119:105). Their influence is undeniable, yet textual criticism reveals flaws when compared to early codices.</p>

                        <p><h3>1. American Standard Version (1901):</h3> This translation restored “Jehovah” in the Old Testament but used “Lord” in New Testament quotes, diluting “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). It retained questionable texts (e.g., Mark 16:9-20), reflecting reliance on later manuscripts.</p>
                        <p><h3>2. Revised Standard Version (1952):</h3> Using “LORD” broadly with rare “Jehovah” instances, its liberal renderings (e.g., Isaiah 7:14 as “young woman”) sparked controversy, weakening prophetic accuracy.</p>
                        <p><h3>3. New American Standard Bible (NASB, 1971):</h3> More literal, it used “LORD” and included spurious texts (e.g., John 7:53–8:11), unsupported by early manuscripts like Sinaiticus.</p>
                        <p><h3>4. New International Version (NIV, 1978):</h3> Popular with 450 million copies, it omits “Jehovah,” employs dynamic equivalence (paraphrasing), and retains additions (e.g., Mark 16:9-20), reducing fidelity to “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p><h3>5. New King James Version (NKJV, 1982):</h3> Updating the KJV, it retains “LORD” and errors like 1 John 5:7, ignoring older manuscripts like the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
                        <p><h3>6. English Standard Version (ESV, 2001):</h3> Literal but using “LORD” and including questionable texts, it fails to reflect “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <p>Common flaws include omitting “Jehovah,” including spurious texts (e.g., Mark 16:9-20), relying on later manuscripts, and paraphrasing, unlike “Your word is a lamp” (Psalm 119:105). Textual criticism highlights their inaccuracies against early codices.</p>

                        <h2>(1950–2013 CE)</h2>
                        <p><h3>1. RESTORATION OF JEHOVAH'S NAME:</h3> The NWT restores “Jehovah” in the Christian Scriptures where Old Testament quotes (e.g., Matthew 4:4 citing Deuteronomy 8:3) or context (e.g., Acts 2:21) indicate “YHWH” was used. Early Septuagint fragments (e.g., Papyrus Fouad 266, 2nd century BCE) and Hebrew Gospel manuscripts (e.g., Shem-Tob’s Matthew, 14th century copying earlier texts) show “YHWH” in the 1st century. Later scribes substituted “Kyrios” due to Jewish traditions avoiding the divine name, but the NWT corrects this, fulfilling “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <p><h3>2. EXCLUSION OF SPURIOUS TEXTS:</h3> The NWT omits passages absent in the oldest manuscripts (e.g., Codex Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, 4th century), such as 1 John 5:7, Mark 16:9-20, and John 7:53–8:11. These were likely marginal notes or glosses added by copyists, not inspired text—e.g., Mark 16:9-20 appears in 5th-century manuscripts but not Sinaiticus—ensuring “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p><h3>3. FIDELITY TO ORIGINAL TEXTS:</h3> It uses the Aleppo and Leningrad Codices for the Hebrew Scriptures and early Greek manuscripts (e.g., Papyrus P46, 2nd century) for the Christian Scriptures, aligning with “all Scripture is inspired” (2 Timothy 3:16).</p>
                        <p><h3>4. CLEAR, MODERN LANGUAGE:</h3> Precise English clarifies meaning for all, as “Your word is a lamp” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <p><h3>5. SCHOLARLY RIGOR:</h3> Cross-referencing thousands of manuscripts avoids bias, unlike translations swayed by tradition (e.g., NIV’s paraphrasing).</p>
                        <p>The NWT, released in stages (1950–1961, revised 2013), uses “Jehovah” 7,237 times, with over 240 million copies in 200+ languages. Textual alignment with Dead Sea Scrolls (carbon-dated 200 BCE–70 CE) and codices (paleography-dated 325 CE), plus archaeological finds like the Moabite Stone (840 BCE), fulfills “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
