                        <h2>(c. 1500–400 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>The Hebrew Scriptures, the oldest writings of Jehovah’s inspired Word, were penned primarily in Hebrew, with some Aramaic sections, between approximately 1500 and 400 BCE. These dates are determined through paleographic analysis of ancient inscriptions, such as the Gezer Calendar (10th century BCE), and radiocarbon dating of materials like the Silver Scrolls from Ketef Hinnom, dated to around 600 BCE. This collection, known as the Tanakh, includes 39 books divided into the Law (Torah), Prophets (Nevi’im), and Writings (Ketuvim). Moses began this sacred work, recording the Law after receiving divine instructions at Mount Sinai, including the Ten Commandments written by Jehovah’s own hand (Exodus 31:18). Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel later added their inspired messages, guided by holy spirit, ensuring Jehovah’s will was faithfully recorded, as affirmed by “all Scripture is inspired of God” (2 Timothy 3:16).</p>
                        <p>Central to these writings is Jehovah’s name, “YHWH,” which appears 6,973 times, emphasizing its sanctity, as in “I am Jehovah, that is my name” (Isaiah 42:8). The Torah established laws for worship and morality, the Prophets delivered messages of judgment and hope, and the Writings offered wisdom and praise, such as in the Psalms. These texts, written on parchment or papyrus scrolls, were meticulously copied by scribes called Sopherim, who counted letters to ensure accuracy. Stored in synagogues and the temple, they were read aloud to the congregation, strengthening Israel’s covenant with Jehovah. Archaeological finds like the Silver Scrolls, tiny amulets inscribed with blessings invoking “YHWH,” confirm the name’s prominence in daily worship. These writings, free from uninspired additions, set the standard for divine truth, fulfilling “the word of our God endures forever” (Isaiah 40:8).</p>

                        <h2>(c. 280–150 BCE)</h2>
                        <p>The Septuagint, or LXX, translated the Hebrew Scriptures into Koine Greek between 280 and 150 BCE, making Jehovah’s Word accessible to Greek-speaking Jews after Alexander the Great’s conquests spread Greek culture. Dating is established through paleographic analysis of early fragments like Papyrus Fouad 266, dated to the 2nd century BCE, and historical records of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who reportedly commissioned the work in Alexandria, Egypt. Tradition holds that 70 (or 72) Jewish scholars completed the translation, ensuring fidelity to the Hebrew originals. Most significantly, early Septuagint copies retained “YHWH” in Hebrew characters, resisting the later substitution of “Kyrios” (Lord), as seen in Papyrus Fouad 266, which includes Deuteronomy passages with the divine name intact, fulfilling “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <p>The Septuagint included the 39 books of the Hebrew Scriptures but also added uninspired texts known as the Apocrypha, such as Tobit and Maccabees, which provide historical context but lack divine inspiration, as they were not part of the Hebrew canon. These additions, often moral or historical in nature, were later accepted by some religious traditions but were not considered scripture by early Jews or faithful Christians. The translation process involved careful comparison with Hebrew scrolls, though some interpretive choices emerged, such as rendering “almah” in Isaiah 7:14 as “parthenos” (virgin), impacting messianic prophecy. Used widely in synagogues, the Septuagint became the Bible of early Christians, quoted in the Christian Scriptures (e.g., Matthew 1:23). Its early retention of “YHWH” underscores its reverence for Jehovah’s name, fulfilling “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15).</p>

                    <summary class="item-button">Early Codices: Jehovah’s Name Fades Amid Uninspired Additions</summary>
                    <div class="item-content">
                        <h2>(c. 325–350 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Early Codices, such as Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, were compiled between 325 and 350 CE, as confirmed by paleographic analysis of their uncial Greek script and radiocarbon dating of their vellum pages. These codices, transitioning from scrolls to bound books, were among the first complete Christian Bibles, containing the Septuagint (Old Testament) and the Christian Scriptures. Codex Sinaiticus, discovered at Saint Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai and now housed in the British Library, occasionally preserves “YHWH” in Hebrew script within Old Testament quotes, showing awareness of the name’s original presence. However, Codex Vaticanus, stored in the Vatican Library, more consistently uses “Kyrios” (Lord), reflecting a growing trend among scribes to avoid pronouncing the divine name due to Jewish traditions, a shift that obscured “I am Jehovah, that is my name” (Isaiah 42:8).</p>
                        <p>These codices, produced during a time of doctrinal disputes and Roman persecution, also included uninspired additions. Codex Sinaiticus contains the Apocrypha, inherited from the Septuagint, and marginal notes by copyists, such as textual variants or commentary, which were not part of the inspired text. For example, Sinaiticus omits the longer ending of Mark (16:9-20), later added in other manuscripts, indicating early textual tampering. Vaticanus similarly lacks this passage and some pastoral epistles, reflecting variations in early transmission. Despite these issues, the codices preserved the core of Jehovah’s Word, serving as key manuscripts for later translations. Their creation by Christian scribes under pressure from apostasy highlights the challenge of maintaining purity, yet their endurance fulfills “the word of Jehovah endures” (1 Peter 1:25).</p>

                        <h2>(c. 382–405 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Latin Vulgate, translated by Jerome between 382 and 405 CE, became the standard Bible of the Western Church, but it further distanced readers from Jehovah’s name. Historical records, including Jerome’s letters, and paleographic analysis of early Vulgate manuscripts, such as the Codex Amiatinus (dated to the early 8th century), confirm this timeline. Commissioned by Pope Damasus I, Jerome worked in Bethlehem, using Hebrew manuscripts for the Old Testament and Greek texts for the Christian Scriptures, revising earlier Old Latin translations. However, following the trend of the time, he replaced “YHWH” with “Dominus” (Lord) throughout, influenced by Jewish and Christian traditions avoiding the divine name, a significant departure from “You, whose name is Jehovah” (Psalm 83:18).</p>
                        <p>The Vulgate included the 39 Hebrew Scripture books, the 27 Christian Scripture books, and the Deuterocanonical books (e.g., Tobit, Maccabees), inherited from the Septuagint but not inspired, as they were absent from the Hebrew canon. These uninspired texts were used for moral instruction but were not scripture. Jerome’s goal was to standardize scripture for the church’s liturgy, producing a unified Latin text for a multilingual empire. The Vulgate’s influence endured for centuries, shaping medieval theology and later translations like the King James Version. However, its removal of Jehovah’s name and inclusion of uninspired texts marked a step away from the original writings, though its preservation of the core message aligns with “Your word is a lamp to my foot” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <p class="scripture">“Your word is a lamp to my foot.” — Psalm 119:105</p>

                        <h2>(Discovered 1947–1956, Written c. 200 BCE–70 CE)</h2>
                        <p>The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered between 1947 and 1956 in the Qumran caves near the Dead Sea, provided undeniable proof that the oldest writings prominently used Jehovah’s name, as “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). These 900+ manuscripts, written between 200 BCE and 70 CE—dated through carbon-14 analysis and paleographic study of their Hebrew script—include nearly every book of the Hebrew Scriptures. The Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa^a), one of the most complete, uses “YHWH” in paleo-Hebrew script to highlight its sanctity, as seen in Isaiah 42:8: “I am Jehovah, that is my name.” Written on parchment and papyrus, the scrolls were likely hidden by the Essenes, a Jewish sect, during the First Jewish-Roman War to protect them from Roman destruction.</p>
                        <p>The scrolls, now housed in the Israel Museum’s Shrine of the Book and the Jordan Museum, reveal a community devoted to scriptural purity. They include biblical texts, sectarian writings (e.g., the Community Rule), and commentaries (e.g., Pesher Habakkuk), showing how the Essenes interpreted prophecy in anticipation of the end times. Unlike later manuscripts, these scrolls contain no uninspired Apocryphal texts or marginal notes, preserving the original Hebrew Scriptures’ integrity. Their text aligns closely with the Masoretic Text (e.g., Leningrad Codex, 1008 CE), with only minor variations, proving scribal accuracy over centuries. This discovery confirmed that Jehovah’s name was central to the oldest writings, countering later translations that omitted it, and set the stage for the New World Translation’s return to these pure sources, fulfilling “My words will not pass away” (Matthew 24:35).</p>

                        <p><h3>Wycliffe Bible (1382):</h3> The first English Bible, translated by John Wycliffe, relied on the Latin Vulgate, which had replaced “YHWH” with “Lord,” obscuring “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). Handwritten copies (British Library) were banned, as they challenged church authority, marking an early reformist effort.</p>
                        <p><h3>Tyndale Bible (1526):</h3> William Tyndale’s translation, the first printed English Bible, used “Jehovah” in places (e.g., Exodus 6:3), but primarily drew from the Vulgate and limited Greek texts like the Textus Receptus, which included uninspired additions. Tyndale was executed in 1536, but his work (British Library) influenced later Bibles.</p>
                        <p><h3>Geneva Bible (1560):</h3> Popular among Puritans, it used “LORD” and relied on the Textus Receptus, incorporating uninspired notes with Calvinist bias (British Library), further straying from the original texts.</p>
                        <p><h3>King James Version (1611):</h3> Commissioned by King James I, it used “LORD” except in four places (e.g., Psalm 83:18). Based on the Textus Receptus, it included uninspired additions like 1 John 5:7, absent in early codices, and its archaic language confuses readers.</p>
                        <p><h3>Revised Version (1885):</h3> Aimed to update the KJV, it used newer manuscripts but retained “LORD” and inconsistent renderings, reflecting reliance on later, less accurate texts.</p>
                        <p>These translations, based on later manuscripts that omitted Jehovah’s name and included uninspired texts, introduced errors like spurious passages (e.g., 1 John 5:7), reliance on incomplete sources, and outdated language, hindering “Your word is a lamp” (Psalm 119:105).</p>

                        <p><h3>American Standard Version (1901):</h3> Restored “Jehovah” in the Old Testament but used “Lord” in New Testament quotes, diluting “This is my name forever” (Exodus 3:15). It relied on later manuscripts, retaining uninspired texts like Mark 16:9-20.</p>
                        <p><h3>Revised Standard Version (1952):</h3> Used “LORD” broadly, with rare “Jehovah” instances. Its liberal renderings (e.g., Isaiah 7:14 as “young woman”) and reliance on later texts weakened prophetic accuracy.</p>
                        <p><h3>New American Standard Bible (NASB, 1971):</h3> More literal, it used “LORD” and included uninspired additions (e.g., John 7:53–8:11), unsupported by early manuscripts.</p>
                        <p><h3>New International Version (NIV, 1978):</h3> Popular with 450 million copies, it omits “Jehovah,” uses paraphrasing, and retains additions (e.g., Mark 16:9-20), straying from “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p><h3>New King James Version (NKJV, 1982):</h3> Updated the KJV but retained “LORD” and errors like 1 John 5:7, ignoring older manuscripts.</p>
                        <p><h3>English Standard Version (ESV, 2001):</h3> Literal but used “LORD” and included questionable texts, failing to reflect “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>

                        <h2>(1950–2013 CE)</h2>
                        <p><h3>Restoration of Jehovah’s Name:</h3> The NWT restores “Jehovah” 7,237 times, including 264 instances in the Christian Scriptures where Old Testament quotes (e.g., Matthew 4:4 citing Deuteronomy 8:3) or context (e.g., Acts 2:21) indicate “YHWH” was used. Early Septuagint fragments (e.g., Papyrus Fouad 266) and Hebrew Gospel manuscripts (e.g., Shem-Tob’s Matthew) confirm “YHWH” in the 1st century, but later scribes substituted “Kyrios” due to traditions avoiding the name. The NWT corrects this, fulfilling “My people will know my name” (Isaiah 52:6).</p>
                        <p><h3>Exclusion of Uninspired Texts:</h3> The NWT omits passages absent in the oldest manuscripts (e.g., Codex Sinaiticus, Papyrus P46), such as 1 John 5:7, Mark 16:9-20, and John 7:53–8:11. These were likely marginal notes or glosses added by copyists, not inspired text, ensuring “Your word is truth” (John 17:17).</p>
                        <p><h3>Reliance on the Oldest Writings:</h3> Inspired by the Dead Sea Scrolls’ confirmation of “YHWH” in the earliest texts, the NWT uses the Aleppo and Leningrad Codices for the Hebrew Scriptures and early Greek manuscripts for the Christian Scriptures, aligning with “all Scripture is inspired” (2 Timothy 3:16).</p>
                        <p><h3>Clear, Modern Language:</h3> Precise English clarifies meaning, as “Your word is a lamp” (Psalm 119:105).</p>
                        <p><h3>Scholarly Rigor:</h3> Cross-referencing thousands of manuscripts avoids bias, unlike translations swayed by tradition.</p>
                        <p>Released in stages (1950–1961, revised 2013), the NWT’s 240 million copies in 200+ languages fulfill “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah” (Isaiah 11:9). Archaeological finds like the Moabite Stone (840 BCE) further affirm “YHWH”’s prominence in the oldest writings.</p>
